		<string _locid="359">I will be a shell of a man until my sweet, sweet Bella is returned home. \n \nShe strays from time to time, but I think now she may be lost. I can send a couple of Scouts and a Priest with you. Please find my girl Bella. She is very gentle, and I worry about her out in the world alone. Just get her back to the yard.

		<string _locid="686">Ye have done it! Little Hesiod and Elpis are with me again.</string>
		<string _locid="688">In my humble opinion, the only way for us to get good at razing villages and cities is to raze more villages and cities. I figured we&apos;d just attack a few, but the king got upset the last time I did that. \n \nSo, I recreated a small village fortress not too far from here. Let&apos;s test your razing skills. \n \nTear down that city as fast as you can.</string>
		<string _locid="689">It&apos;s fun to break things, isn&apos;t it?</string>
		<string _locid="691">Since you seem to like tearing stuff down, let&apos;s see if you can do it a little faster. Interested?</string>
		<string _locid="692">Impressive!</string>
		<string _locid="694">So you fancy yourself a demolition man, huh? Well, this next test should prove much harder.</string>
		<string _locid="695">Now that&apos;s how you bring down the house.</string>
		<string _locid="697">I don&apos;t think this one&apos;s possible. There&apos;s no way you&apos;ll raze the village that quickly. Not without a bomb, anyway.</string>
		<string _locid="698">I hope the civilizations you fight have strong buildings.</string>

		<string _locid="714">A Friendly Little Loan</string>
		<string _locid="716">Excellent. What could go wrong with high-risk variable-interest home loans?</string>
		<string _locid="717">Last-Minute Cleanup</string>
		<string _locid="719">Well done. Controlling that coastline gives us early warning of invasion by sea.</string>
		<string _locid="720">A Few Good Men</string>
		<string _locid="723">Restore the Treasury</string>
		<string _locid="725">Excellent. The city&apos;s coffers are full once more.</string>
		<string _locid="726">Preaching to the Masses</string>
		<string _locid="728">Excellent! More converts are always welcome!</string>
		<string _locid="729">Spread the Word</string>

		<string _locid="744">Give to the Needy</string>
		<string _locid="746">Thank you, friend! Mycenae is fortunate to have such good neighbors.</string>

		<string _locid="753">Show Our Power</string>
		<string _locid="756">Protect Our People</string>
		<string _locid="759">Wanted: Boar Tusks</string>
		<string _locid="760">Wild boar can be found throughout Greece almost anywhere you go. Not only are they good for food, but also Mycenaean crafters can sometimes use their tusks. \n \nKill these beasts and bring proof to King Agamemnon to receive your rewards.</string>
		<string _locid="761">I hope this quest was not a boar for you.</string>
		<string _locid="762">Treasures can be found throughout the world, often guarded by unscrupulous criminals. \n \nKeep whatever treasures that are found. Just bring back proof of killing 50 guardians to the docks.</string>
		<string _locid="763">Good start, but there are always more criminals to be found.</string>
		<string _locid="764">Wanted: The Vill Killers</string>
		<string _locid="765">Dangerous predators found throughout Mycenae are a constant hazard to our people. \n \nKill these beasts and bring proof to King Agamemnon to receive your rewards.</string>
		<string _locid="766">Is It Any Wonder!</string>
		<string _locid="770">The Sea People encroach ever closer to my people. Our only hope is to flee across the sea. We seek master sailors to build a fleet for us.\n \nCan you help? You must complete the fleet before the Sea People find us and slaughter everyone.</string>
		<string _locid="771">The fleet is ready just in time. We will set out for new lands on the morning tide. Thank you.</string>
		<string _locid="773">Thanks to you, the fleet stands ready to sail, but we need a leader for their voyage. \n \nYou&apos;ve helped so much already, but the lives of many are still at risk. Can you help guide my people to a new land to call their own? You will be rewarded.</string>
		<string _locid="774">A new land has been claimed. Now we must try to keep it.</string>
		<string _locid="776">The Sea People are like vermin. They appear to be infinite in number, and they attack everywhere. \n \nAt present, they encroach ever closer to my cousin&apos;s people. As was once our lot, their only hope is to flee. \n \nAs we once did, they now seek master sailors to build a fleet for them. I kind of told them about what you did for us. I hope you don&apos;t mind...</string>
		<string _locid="777">Good! The fleet is ready just in time.</string>
		<string _locid="779">The fleet you built for my cousin&apos;s people is ready to sail. As we once did, they now need a leader for their voyage. \n \nI might have told them that you handled this for us...</string>
		<string _locid="780">A new land has been claimed! Thank you.</string>
		<string _locid="782">I have a funny story for you. So, strangely enough, I have more than one cousin. And, believe it or not, this other cousin&apos;s people are also under attack by the Sea People. \n \nTheir only hope is to flee across the sea. They need a fleet to do this. \n \nYou know what I&apos;m going to ask, right?</string>
		<string _locid="783">Thanks. They&apos;re going to sail with the morning tide, just like the last batch of cousins.</string>
		<string _locid="785">Yeah, so, that fleet is all ready. You did really great work. Again. \n \nAny chance you might lead their voyage? They won&apos;t leave until they have someone capable in charge.</string>
		<string _locid="786">I have high hopes for this cousin&apos;s people. I think they&apos;re going to make it.</string>
		<string _locid="787">Live Together, Die Together</string>
		<string _locid="788">Conflict always attracts opportunists. \n \nAs if there weren&apos;t enough to deal with already, a column of reinforcements has been ambushed and wiped out. The few survivors say they were attacked by Greeks. I suspect a rogue general is attempting to carve off some territory for himself. \n \nCan you travel to the region where my men were ambushed and look for these vultures? They were numerous and powerful. You will need someone to help you.</string>
		<string _locid="789">You took care of the mercenaries, but it&apos;s worse than I expected. That was only their scouting force. Their actual army will not be far behind.</string>
		<string _locid="790">Best Friends Forever</string>
		<string _locid="791">I thought a direct attack might end the threat of the mercenaries quickly, but it seems all I&apos;ve accomplished is to attract more attention. \n \nA new force marched into the area, under a banner that marks them as troops of Clearchus. If the man commanding them is in fact a captain in the service of Clearchus, then he is a very capable officer with troops that include many Spartans. \n \nHe cannot be allowed to get a foothold here.</string>
		<string _locid="792">Outstanding work. Perhaps they will get the message now.</string>
		<string _locid="793">I&apos;m Nothing Without You</string>
		<string _locid="794">Well. Perhaps I should not have been so hasty. \n \nYou routed the scouts. And then dealt with the captain Clearchus sent in response. But that has not caused the mercenaries to waver. \n \nIn fact, Clearchus seems more interested in us now. An entire army of his, under the command of his archon, has been diverted toward us. I don&apos;t need to tell you how dangerous that is.</string>
		<string _locid="795">Ha! Clearchus cannot ignore the message you&apos;ve sent. There are easier targets out there. He will aim for them.</string>
		<string _locid="796">We&apos;re Like Peas and Carrots</string>
		<string _locid="797">Oh, my. \n \nYour defeat of his archon certainly earned the attention of Clearchus. He has sent his second in command, the polemarch who leads half of his entire mercenary force, to seek you out. \n \nYou should probably kill him. And all his men. Before they get anywhere near here.</string>
		<string _locid="798">Amazing. Certainly, Clearchus cannot keep wasting the lives of his men like this, can he?</string>
		<string _locid="799">You Complete Me</string>
		<string _locid="800">Well, the good news is, if you survive this, there cannot be another, larger attack. \n \nThe bad news is, Clearchus himself is about. And he has all his remaining troops with him.</string>
		<string _locid="801">You and your friend are amazing commanders. The legendary Clearchus has been defeated!</string>
		<string _locid="802">Cleaning Out the Filth</string>
		<string _locid="803">Thanks to you, my people are safe. I, however, am not concerned with &quot;safe&quot; for myself. I am interested in vengeance. \n \nWill you help me deliver what they deserve?</string>
		<string _locid="804">We have finally started to make these lands safe. Thank you.</string>
		<string _locid="805">Rescue Mission</string>
		<string _locid="806">My people have sent word. They need help securing their new home. \n \nCould you go to their aid and keep the Sea People from destroying this place too?</string>
		<string _locid="807">Now my people are safe. They can rest knowing that their homeland has been cleansed.</string>
		<string _locid="808">We Killed These Guys Already!</string>
		<string _locid="809">It would appear that some Followers of Autolycus survived their earlier encounters with you, because they are harassing cities throughout the country once again. \n \nThese weeds should be pulled before they have a chance to spread. Surely they are now only a fraction as powerful as they once were, but... in time...</string>
		<string _locid="810">I seem to have underestimated the strength of the Followers of Autolycus. They appear stronger than they ever were before. Still, a job well done, and you took some wind out of their sails.</string>
		<string _locid="811">Why Does It Have to Be Bandits?</string>
		<string _locid="812">It is clear now that we did not happen onto the Followers of Autolycus while they were regrouping. They had already regrouped, and these attacks are part of a coordinated plan. \n \nUntil we clear out most of the villages belonging to the Followers of Autolycus, we will not be able to travel safely from city to city in this area.</string>
		<string _locid="813">A job well done.</string>
		<string _locid="814">Left with No Choice</string>
		<string _locid="815">We have no choice but to hunt the Followers of Autolycus down and eradicate them all. If we leave any alive, they&apos;ll only return later. \n \nFind them. All of them.</string>
		<string _locid="816">Excellent. I&apos;m sure that is the last we&apos;ll see of them.</string>
		<string _locid="826">Celebrate Hekatombia</string>
		<string _locid="827">We really like to sacrifice cows here in Argos, but someone has been stealing them. \n \nWe need to get our cattle back so our priests can slaughter them. Can you help? The king will be very pleased if you do.</string>
		<string _locid="828">Wonderful! Our priests will be thrilled!</string>
		<string _locid="829">Find the Pharaoh&apos;s Favorite</string>
		<string _locid="831">Oh, thank Ra! He must never know I lost her.</string>
		<string _locid="832">Find Pharaoh&apos;s Luggage</string>
		<string _locid="834">Oh, thank Ra! He must never know I lost all his stuff. Hope those Sea People didn&apos;t stink it up too much! \n \nThere&apos;s definitely more luggage to find out there. I&apos;ll reward you for every bit you find!</string>
		<string _locid="835">Kill the Chieftain!</string>
		<string _locid="838">Kill More Chieftains!</string>
		<string _locid="841">Sink the Command Ship</string>
		<string _locid="842">The Sea People are commanding their fleet from a single huge vessel. We must find that boat and sink it. Only then can we hope to push the Sea People from our lands! \n \nIf we spot any enemy camps while we&apos;re out there, we should destroy those as well.</string>
		<string _locid="843">Ha! Without that ship, the Sea People&apos;s navy will be in total disarray!</string>
		<string _locid="850">Stop the Sea People</string>
		<string _locid="851">It&apos;s time to go on the offensive. Our scouts report nearby islands are crawling with Sea People. They must be staging attacks from these places. Find them and kill them before they have a chance to set foot in Argos. \n \nBe on the lookout for their navy too. There are rumors of a giant ship among their fleet.</string>
		<string _locid="852">The Sea People are learning to fear the power of Argos, but I&apos;m afraid this fight isn&apos;t over. With your help, we can push them away from our lands forever.</string>
		<string _locid="853">Do Something Cool for Me</string>
		<string _locid="856">Egyptian Alliance</string>
		<string _locid="860">You have cast the armies of the Sea People into disarray. Although they can no longer threaten us with organized attacks, their scattered troops attack whatever they happen to be near, looking for food and treasure. \n \nScouts report one of these rogue elements headed toward Argos. If we act quickly, we can catch these troops in the mountain passes and ambush them! \n \nGet out there and prepare an ambush to defeat them.</string>
		<string _locid="861">Was ambushing those Sea People fun? I hope so!	</string>
		<string _locid="865">Lots of Rogues!</string>
		<string _locid="868">Cataclysm</string>
		<string _locid="869">Now that their navy is out of the way, it&apos;s time to finish the Sea People. Their island stronghold is their final foothold in our land. End this war. Now.</string>
		<string _locid="870">Good work! I doubt we&apos;ll see the Sea People in those numbers again any time soon. You have the thanks of the people of Argos, and our eternal friendship!</string>
		<string _locid="874">Losing Your Religion</string>
		<string _locid="877">All-Out War!</string>
		<string _locid="878">It is clear that the Sea People will just keep coming. Through my keen understanding of history and strategy, I&apos;ve concluded that the only hope we have is to kill every last one of them. \n \nAttack one of the islands that they inhabit and conquer it. It doesn&apos;t matter which island as long as there are Sea People there. We will just have to clear them out one island at a time.</string>
		<string _locid="879">That&apos;s one! Keep up the good work.</string>
		<string _locid="880">Get Our Houses Back</string>
		<string _locid="882">Finally! Maybe we can get some peace around here.</string>
		<string _locid="883">It Burns Us</string>
		<string _locid="886">Run the Blockade</string>
		<string _locid="888">Excellent! The Sea People&apos;s navy is crippled! All that&apos;s left is to finish them once and for all!</string>
		<string _locid="889">Dock Rats!</string>
		<string _locid="892">Harass the Sea People</string>
		<string _locid="893">The Sea People are tenacious. We need to keep the pressure on, or they&apos;ll regroup for a counterattack.\n \nOur scouts report the nearby islands are still crawling with Sea People soldiers. Find them and reduce their numbers. \n \nBe on the lookout for their navy. Rumors say they have many powerful ships.</string>
		<string _locid="894">Excellent! They&apos;re learning to fear us. With your help, I believe we can push the Sea People away from our lands forever.</string>
		<string _locid="895">Retake the Islands</string>
		<string _locid="898">We Can Always Use More</string>
		<string _locid="899">It&apos;s silly to haul these resources back one at a time. Go out and load up everything, I&apos;ll make sure it gets back to Argos.\n \nYou&apos;ll run into resistance, so build strong defenses or an army. \n \nThe enemy is on to us now and has attacked the ships I use to transport what you&apos;ve gathered. Those ships won&apos;t be able to wait forever, so you will need to gather all the resources quickly.</string>

		<string _locid="1074">Troy was defeated, but you might not know it to look at how the remaining Trojans behave. They have some &quot;issues&quot; with authority. \n \nIf we&apos;re going to control them, we&apos;re going to have show them we mean business. Assemble a large enough force to be intimidating.</string>
		<string _locid="1075">Nice work! Seeing all those troops sitting there should keep the Trojans in line.</string>
		<string _locid="1077">Some of the Trojans have gotten the message, but there are still those who think they can oppose us. If we show them an even larger force, they should quiet down.</string>
		<string _locid="1078">Nice work! All these troops should keep these Trojans in line.</string>
		<string _locid="1080">Only the dimmest of Trojans think they can oppose our rule now, but these dullards still try to convince their fellows to rebel. \n \nLet&apos;s push the limits and build the largest force imaginable. A force no sane person could suggest opposing.</string>
		<string _locid="1081">Wow! Getting an army of that size together that quickly makes it clear standing up to us will be futile.</string>
		<string _locid="1082">Returning Home</string>
		<string _locid="1083">The work your armies performed at Troy ensured Helen&apos;s safe return. My soldiers, as well as those of King Odysseus, will be returning home to their families after our victory. \n \nReturn to your homeland and tell your people of your great accomplishments. I will send great rewards with you.</string>
		<string _locid="1084">It is good to see the safe return of your great army.</string>
		<string _locid="1085">Helen Has Been Taken!</string>

		<string _locid="1100">I Have a Cunning Plan</string>
		<string _locid="1101">If Agamemnon&apos;s all-out assault goes as well as I think it will, we&apos;ll need to find another way through the gates of Troy. I have an idea that might get us in, but I&apos;ll need Pine Planks and Animal Hides first.</string>
		<string _locid="1102">Excellent! Now let&apos;s hope I can convince Agamemnon to try my way before he gets us all killed.</string>

		<string _locid="1494">Camels cannot do such things. Their legs will come off.</string>

		<string _locid="1500">Build fortifications to prevent the Nubian army from passing.</string>

		<string _locid="1508">Work with the Medjay to conquer Napata.</string>
		<string _locid="1511">The Medjay will not last long. We must support them.</string>

		<string _locid="1515">The coastal villages won&apos;t survive without your help. Hurry!</string>

		<string _locid="1576">Let&apos;s go. You&apos;ll never get better at tearing down people&apos;s homes just sitting here.</string>
		<string _locid="1577">Tear down the test city as quickly as you can.</string>
		<string _locid="1578">Those buildings won&apos;t fall down by themselves.</string>
		<string _locid="1579">Not enough time, Demolition Man!</string>
		<string _locid="1580">I told you... not without a bomb.</string>
		<string _locid="1585">Mycenae is in danger! To arms!</string>

		<string _locid="1632">I&apos;ve got a lot of cousins, and they all have their own people who need fleets.</string>
		<string _locid="1633">You should see family dinners at our house. We need a really big table.</string>
		<string _locid="1634">The mercenaries must be stopped. If they aren&apos;t, we&apos;ll soon have every man with a spear running about and trying to take a piece.</string>
		<string _locid="1636">If Clearchus gets the idea that this area is easy pickings, we&apos;ll have mercenaries stabbing us by dinner.</string>
		<string _locid="1638">Clearchus has a lot of mean, angry, heavily armed troops...</string>
		<string _locid="1639">Clearchus certainly has a lot of troops, doesn&apos;t he?</string>
		<string _locid="1640">Who would have thought that chasing off a few scouts would lead to Clearchus rampaging about with a giant mercenary army? Not I, I assure you...</string>
		<string _locid="1641">Our land is still threatened by invaders.</string>
		<string _locid="1643">My people need your help to secure their new homeland.</string>
		<string _locid="1644">The longer we take, the stronger the bandits get.</string>
		<string _locid="1646">Our safety depends on you.</string>
		<string _locid="1647">It is the only way.</string>
		<string _locid="1654">Find any of those cows yet?</string>
		<string _locid="1656">Have you found that camel yet? Find her soon, or she might turn into Sea People lunch!</string>
		<string _locid="1663">That ship must be destroyed!</string>
		<string _locid="1669">Strike back at the Sea People. Quickly.</string>
		<string _locid="1670">Attack and defeat the Sea People&apos;s armies in the coastal islands.</string>
		<string _locid="1673">I&apos;d really like to keep my head. Go smash those Sea People for me.</string>
		<string _locid="1679">Make sure you hide all the bodies from the previous ambushes. When I&apos;m walking through a pass in the mountains and I come across hundreds of corpses, I sometimes consider turning around.</string>
		<string _locid="1680">Time to hit the Sea People where they live!</string>
		<string _locid="1681">Defeat the Sea People.</string>
		<string _locid="1684">By the gods, what is taking you so long?</string>
		<string _locid="1686">Keep the pressure on those Sea People.</string>
		<string _locid="1692">The Sea People navy is still a threat!</string>
		<string _locid="1695">Those Sea People are still out there.</string>
		<string _locid="1696">Attack and defeat the Sea People in the coastal islands.</string>
		<string _locid="1698">My ships are ready to haul back all that you gather.</string>
		<string _locid="1717">I understand if you&apos;re not able to hold out this long.</string>
		<string _locid="1747">Why the delay? We must have delicious broccoli!</string>
		<string _locid="1749">Why the delay? The people yearn for more broccoli.</string>
		<string _locid="1751">Two words: More. Broccoli.</string>
		<string _locid="1754">Where are the Farms? What are you going to tell the children when they ask where their broccoli is?</string>
		<string _locid="1773">What are ye waiting for? Let&apos;s get the Followers of Autolycus out of my ocean.</string>
		<string _locid="1789">Some of the locals are getting a bit restless. Let&apos;s put them in their place.</string>
		<string _locid="1790">Build a large force.</string>
		<string _locid="1791">If you let them think they can make the rules, we&apos;ll be in real trouble.</string>
		<string _locid="1792">Build a large force.</string>
		<string _locid="1793">Can a force this large be built so quickly? And if it can, how will we pay them? I&apos;ll worry about that later...</string>
		<string _locid="1794">Build the largest force possible.</string>
		<string _locid="1795">Time to go home.</string>
		<string _locid="1797">Where are those Pine Planks?</string>
		<string _locid="1799">Troy still controls areas along the coast. Clear them out and set up forward positions there.</string>
		<string _locid="1801">Have you escorted the camps to the coast yet?</string>
		<string _locid="1803">Hector must die!</string>
		<string _locid="1807">Oh, I&apos;ve got a plan, all right.</string>
		<string _locid="1809">Have you taken care of my elite problem yet?</string>
		<string _locid="1810">While out questing in the world, find and kill any elite troops you see.</string>
		<string _locid="1815">Our moment of triumph is here!</string>
		<string _locid="1817">What is it?</string>
		<string _locid="1820">King Agamemnon needs you to hold off the Trojans.</string>
		<string _locid="1821">Offer to help New Troy.</string>
		<string _locid="1826">Are you going to help us? If you don&apos;t, perhaps I should be curious about your reasons for being here...</string>
		<string _locid="1832">SUMMARY</string>
		<string _locid="1844">Look, I&apos;ll level with you. I&apos;m getting pretty tired of these mercenaries, though I admire their persistence. I&apos;m guessing they&apos;re getting pretty tired of being smacked-down because they&apos;ve amassed the biggest horde I&apos;ve ever seen, and it&apos;s headed right for Crete.\n \nOur Scouts have reported 40 armies in the area, and they&apos;re the most ill-mannered, surly, depraved, vicious, and savage group of Lelegan Mercenaries in existence.\n \nYou know the drill: We can&apos;t hold them off for much longer, time is running out, etcetera. Bring a friend.</string>
		<string _locid="1845">Amazing! I thought they had you toward the end, but you pulled it out. They won&apos;t be back for - I don&apos;t know - at least a week. </string>
		<string _locid="1846">Those mercenaries won&apos;t defeat themselves.</string>
		<string _locid="1847">Defend the Wonder from 40 waves of the most ill-mannered, surly, depraved, vicious, and savage Lelegan Mercenaries in existence.</string>
		<string _locid="1848">Cretins on the Coast!</string>
		<string _locid="1854">Mercenaries at the Mount!</string>
		<string _locid="2054">Blessed Zeus, you&apos;ve finally arrived!\n \nA nearby outpost has come under attack from a group of raiding Clubmen.\n \nAs your Village Elder, I advise you to defend the outpost and show the citizens of Greece that they are safe to settle new lands.</string>
		<string _locid="2055">The hero returns! The people will not forget that you came to their rescue.</string>
		<string _locid="2057">Eliminate all of the Clubmen attacking the outpost.</string>
		<string _locid="2059">Full bellies and a swelling population, eh? Excellent work. You&apos;re well on your way to earning the trust and respect of the people.</string>
		<string _locid="2068">I remember this time! Wait, did I tell you about testing the new Storehouse building?</string>
		<string _locid="2075">The word on the street is that the people are ready to fight for you, but they will need proper equipment to do so.\n \nHere is a blueprint for a Gear Hall. Once placed in your Capital City, it can be used to outfit your armies with weapons and armor.</string>
		<string _locid="2076">Be sure to check for gear in the stores you encounter while visiting other regions and players.</string>
		<string _locid="2077">Let me see if I can find the right blueprint... actually, didn&apos;t I already give you the Gear Hall blueprint? Is it in your inventory?</string>
		<string _locid="2078">Use the blueprint in your inventory to construct a Gear Hall in your Capital City.</string>
		<string _locid="2080">Your victory here sends a clear message to those who think the people are easy prey. After all, they&apos;re your people now.</string>
		<string _locid="2081">You must take the fight to those who attack your people.</string>
		<string _locid="2082">Build a Barracks to produce an army of Spearmen, and use them to destroy all of the buildings belonging to the Followers of Autolycus.</string>
		<string _locid="2085">You are a wise leader! The citizens look forward to future displays of our technological prowess.</string>
		<string _locid="2093">Good job. They will think twice before attacking us again.</string>
		<string _locid="2094">If we don&apos;t fight back, they won&apos;t stop.</string>
		<string _locid="2105">Eliminate all the Badari attacking the outpost.</string>

		<string _locid="3013">I once caught a fish this big. How about you?</string>
		<string _locid="3056">Whew! That bought us precious time. I hope the Scouts return soon with all the information we need to counterattack.</string>
		<string _locid="3057">We kicked the hornet&apos;s nest! The Followers of Autolycus are on their way to our new colonies, hoping to reclaim their old territory. \n \nDefend the Town Center! I will send the village Scouts to find their bases while they are occupied battling you.</string>
		<string _locid="3061">Defend the Town Center from the Followers of Autolycus.</string>
		<string _locid="3062">Please save our colony from the Followers of Autolycus!</string>
		<string _locid="3065">It seems safe, for now. They&apos;ll come back. They always come back.</string>
		<string _locid="3067">I received a letter from a small village on the outskirts of Sicyon. \n \nKing Thyestes of Mycenae has sent his armies against them, and the villagers can barely protect themselves. We must defend them and push the Mycenaean army out. \n \nGo there and help conquer the area. Success will help develop our relationship with Sicyon.</string>
		<string _locid="3068">Sicyon will not forget the help we provided.</string>
		<string _locid="3069">Have you helped our future friends yet?</string>
		<string _locid="3072">Sicyon is in the middle of a real mess. Mycenae is raiding their villages, and the Followers of Autolycus fled us to take root in their lands. \n \nFar outside Sicyon proper is their Advisor Hall, unguarded. The Followers of Autolycus are on their way to plunder it.\n \nWe cannot get an army there in time, but you can lead the villagers in mounting a defense with whatever they have on hand.</string>
		<string _locid="3074">Unbelievable! Sicyon&apos;s Advisor Hall survives. They are very grateful.</string>
		<string _locid="3075">The Advisor Hall is right in the path of those barbarians!</string>
		<string _locid="3086">While you were defending the Advisor Hall, we received an honored guest: Agamemnon of Mycenae. King Thyestes is his uncle, but the previous king was Agamemnon&apos;s father, Atreus. After hearing of our successes against the Mycenaean army at Sicyon, he left Sparta to seek our aid. \n \nSpeak with Agamemnon, and let us place the proper king on the throne.</string>
		<string _locid="3088">My cousin slew my father, and now my uncle uses what is rightfully my title to wage pointless wars. Help me end it!</string>
		<string _locid="3089">Greetings, friend. Do you agree that my cause is righteous?</string>
		<string _locid="3090">Speak with Agamemnon.</string>
		<string _locid="3101">Congratulations, your strong and steady leadership has led us into a glorious new Age! Now we can unlock technologies that were once beyond our reach.\n \nAs your Village Elder, I advise you to select a variety of technologies of your choosing. With these new advancements, you will be able to efficiently expand your empire.</string>
		<string _locid="3115">Oh, this isn&apos;t good.\n \nI have learned the identity of the group behind the attacks on outposts in this region, and as I feared, it is the Followers of Autolycus. Cowards, all of them, preying only upon the weak!\n \nNow is the time to strike back, to show the people that you are the great leader they need and to guarantee a bright future for your empire. You must prepare an army and drive these cretins from our lands!</string>
		<string _locid="3129">Battle Between Friends</string>

		<string _locid="3223">Those Hetairoi know how to walk softly and carry a big stick. Except they&apos;re on horses. And the stick is on fire.</string>
		<string _locid="3224">Defend the outer village of Sicyon by defeating Thyestes&apos; armies.</string>
		<string _locid="3230">I could never have done this without you, friend. It will take time to repair all that Thyestes has broken during his rule. Visit me again after I have assumed full control.</string>
		<string _locid="3232">There is no time for doubt. Thyestes&apos; end is so close.</string>
		<string _locid="3233">Destroy King Thyestes&apos; Fortress, and then kill King Thyestes.</string>
		<string _locid="3235">Do you hear that? It is the sound of victory!</string>
		<string _locid="3243">Terrible news! Our scouts found a giant camp belonging to the Followers of Autolycus. \n \nEvery building must burn, or else they will just rebuild the camp. \n \nAdvising Commander Jason from the city of Helice has sent his best Hetairoi to aid us.</string>
		<string _locid="3244">Barracks Destroyed</string>
		<string _locid="3247">Stables Destroyed</string>
		<string _locid="3251">Man cannot live forever on whatever equipment they might find guarded by complete strangers. We have many skilled craftsmen who merely need a place to hone their craft. \n \nThis is a blueprint for a Crafting Hall. From here, you can select the Crafting Schools our people should focus on.</string>
		<string _locid="3254">I once made a fish out of wood. It didn&apos;t taste very good.</string>
		<string _locid="3260">What a beautiful hall! Surely we are the envy of our neighbors.</string>
		<string _locid="3261">Advisors are awfully picky about where they want to live.</string>
		<string _locid="3281">The neighboring city of Sicyon is between a rock and a hard place. Thyestes of Mycenae is mobilizing his armies against them, and the villagers outside Sicyon are asking if we can shelter them until their lands are peaceful again. Unfortunately, the Followers of Autolycus fled towards Sicyon, so they are directly in the path between the refugees and safety! \n \nWe have a small outpost we can use as a refugee camp. Help the villagers make it to the camp by defeating the Followers of Autolycus!</string>
		<string _locid="3283">Our allies are safe in our lands for now. I can only hope Sicyon itself remains standing.</string>
		<string _locid="3284">The refugees have no hope of making it past the Followers of Autolycus on their own.</string>
		<string _locid="3291">Protect Sicyon&apos;s Advisor Hall.</string>
		<string _locid="3297">I&apos;d Like an Advisor with That Hall</string>
		<string _locid="3342">Homer Run</string>
		<string _locid="3343">Clitus Attacks</string>
		<string _locid="3344">Draco&apos;s Legion</string>
		<string _locid="3349">It has been many years since I last saw Mycenae. There are stories I could tell you. This one time, I was walking down its streets. No wait, I shouldn&apos;t tell that story. Never mind.</string>
		<string _locid="3360">Protect Sicyon&apos;s Advisor Hall.</string>
		<string _locid="3362">The Advisor Hall still stands, but not for long.</string>
		<string _locid="3363">The Followers of Autolycus are determined to take down Sicyon&apos;s Advisor Hall. We may need to help Sicyon defend it forever, as far as I know. \n \nAgain, we cannot get an army there in time, so protect that building with Guard Towers and whatever else you have before the Followers descend on it.</string>
		<string _locid="3364">We have found where the Followers of Autolycus have been coming ashore. Except now they are sailing back to the north so they can regroup and attack in larger numbers. If we take out all their Docks in this area, it will strand a lot of them here so we can deal with them in smaller numbers.</string>
		<string _locid="3370">Agamemnon has successfully assumed the throne in Mycenae. He sent a messenger asking for your presence. \n \nI am sure the city needs help after Thyestes&apos; rule, and any help we can give to our friend will be appreciated.</string>
		<string _locid="3371">The Village Elder would like you to talk to King Agamemnon in Mycenae.</string>
		<string _locid="3372">Ah, the champion of Mycenae graces us! Have you come to help rebuild?</string>
		<string _locid="3373">Now that the cowards who followed King Thyestes are on the run, our outlying villages are in danger. \n \nThere&apos;s not much time, but we need to get defenders out to the villages until Thyestes&apos;s retreating rabble have gone. Do not let these fleeing villains pillage any of the outlying villages.</string>
		<string _locid="3377">Good work! Now our enemies will think twice before launching an attack.</string>
		<string _locid="3378">Build Fortresses in the specified locations.</string>
		<string _locid="3379">Protect the allied Town Centers from King Thyestes&apos; loyalists.</string>
		<string _locid="3383">The underhanded Trojans have taken my brother&apos;s faithful wife, Helen. For that, they will pay. I have called together the largest army of Greeks the world has ever seen. Their boots will walk atop the rubble of Troy. \n \nI assume you, of course, wish to have your name prominent among those who form this historic force? \n \nGood. We need a mighty fleet to carry this army across the Aegean. Bring me 100 Pine Planks so we may build ships and set sail for Troy.</string>
		<string _locid="3388">The invasion is set. Thanks to your efforts, our armies are loaded and the fleet is ready to sail. \n \nOnce we reach the shores of Troy, your soldiers are to secure the beaches defended by a powerful Fortress. Clear the outer defenses of Troy by destroying this Fortress.</string>
		<string _locid="3389">Storm the beach and destroy the Trojan Fortress to weaken Troy&apos;s first line of defense.</string>
		<string _locid="3391">Secure Troy&apos;s beach by destroying the Fortress.</string>
		<string _locid="3392">Docks Destroyed</string>
		<string _locid="3393">Our forces have solidified their foothold on the beaches of Troy, and King Odysseus has made camp there. Odysseus is a wise man. If we are to rescue fair Helen, we must travel to the beach camp at Troy and seek his counsel. \n \nLet us travel there and help him bring victory to Greece!</string>
		<string _locid="3394">King Agamemnon would like you to travel to the Troy Beach Camp and and talk to Odysseus.</string>
		<string _locid="3396">The beaches are under our control, but only because the Trojans do not realize how easily we could be thrown back into the sea. \n \nBefore they get wise, I need your soldiers to construct defensible positions for our forces. Clear out the last of Troy&apos;s forward defenses and construct Town Centers in their former locations. \n \nAfter that, we are here to stay.</string>
		<string _locid="3397">Excellent work. Not only have we solidified our defense, we can now mount attacks from the locations you secured.</string>
		<string _locid="3398">Clear out Troy&apos;s defenses and build Town Centers in the marked locations.</string>
		<string _locid="3401">The Trojan opposition has demoralized some of the troops. I guess most were expecting that we would appear in great numbers and frighten them into returning Helen without bloodshed. \n \nIf our fragile alliance starts to fracture, we&apos;ll have a hard time keeping enough troops in place to get the job done. We need to parade some Heroes before the soldiers. That should give them a shot of courage. \n \nFind three Heroes and tell them to return to me.</string>
		<string _locid="3402">I can already see the change in attitude at the camp. I am certain we will make short work of Troy.</string>
		<string _locid="3403">Where are our Heroes?</string>
		<string _locid="3407">Keep what I am about to say to yourself. I&apos;ve been looking at Troy&apos;s army and defenses, and I am now certain that she is too difficult for our force. Hector leads the Trojan forces with great skill, and his presence emboldens his men.\n \nAchilles has volunteered to track down and deal with Hector and his elite guard. If Hector can be slain, then all of Troy will be shattered. \n \nSince this mission cannot afford to fail, we need you. With help from Achilles, track down and kill Hector.</string>
		<string _locid="3408">Join Achilles to kill Hector and his elite guards.</string>
		<string _locid="3409">We will give Troy a few days to mourn the loss of Hector. After that, they will mourn the loss of Troy itself.</string>
		<string _locid="3410">The Trojans are weak enough, but their walls are not. We will have to use our wits. \n \nNever fear, I have a plan. First, we convince the Trojans that we are leaving. \n \nTake a small force and escort our packed-up camps back to the coast.</string>
		<string _locid="3413">The time has come for our final gambit. The Trojans believe we have given up, and our men have spent the past three days constructing a giant wooden horse, a symbol of Troy. I have constructed a ruse that will trick the Trojans into accepting the horse into their city as a gift. Little do they know that this horse holds our greatest warriors. \n \nOnce night falls, order the men to leave the Trojan Horse and destroy the Gate House. This will allow Achilles to enter with his men. Lead Achilles to the Troy Palace, and we will have rescued Helen.</string>
		<string _locid="3414">Use the soldiers in the Trojan Horse to destroy the Gate House, then escort Achilles to the Troy Palace.</string>
		<string _locid="3415">Victory at last! We can finally head home to our families. \n \nWe owe a great debt to you and your people. We can never repay you for all you&apos;ve done, but please take these treasures from our campaign.</string>
		<string _locid="3418">Talk to the Magistrate in New Troy.</string>
		<string _locid="3419">I received a message from King Agamemnon. Most of the battle in Troy is done, but there is a lot of rebuilding. Since he was so impressed by your help in Mycenae, he wants you to go to New Troy and help the Magistrate there.</string>
		<string _locid="3421">Defend Mycenae from the invaders.</string>

		<string _locid="3530">That Food won&apos;t gather itself.</string>
		<string _locid="3531">With the outpost saved, the people need to be shown how to fend for themselves. As the saying goes, give the fish a man and the fish will be fed... hmm, that doesn&apos;t sound quite right.\n \nI remember now! Return to the outpost and get the people familiar with the many ways they can gather Food, and then train more Villagers from the Town Center.</string>
		<string _locid="3532">A great man once said that technology is first learned, and then applied. Wait, I said that, just then. Am I a great man?\n \nAnyway, this is the ideal time to test out your new Storehouses. Return to the outpost and build a Storehouse near the forest so you can easily gather Wood. Use the Wood to build Houses, which will allow you to increase the outpost&apos;s population.</string>

		<string _locid="3563">Find another Wonder and tear it to the ground.</string>
		<string _locid="3565">King Thyestes didn&apos;t just have one Wonder dedicated to himself. He had many. He must have had everyone in the city working on the blasted things. \n \nWe could be tearing these Wonders down forever, but nobody wants to be reminded of the old fool.</string>
		<string _locid="3567">There are still some troublemakers in this region. Have you destroyed the Temples yet?</string>
		<string _locid="3568">Ah, excellent work. Now that we&apos;ve destroyed their Temples, I&apos;m sure these people will be easier to keep in line.</string>
		<string _locid="3569">Paris escaped the city during our attack and is causing all manner of trouble. Among other things, he is now trying to rally the locals in the countryside to fight back against my control. \n \nThey seem to be rallying at their Temples, so let&apos;s take those down and give them a little less to believe in.</string>
		<string _locid="3570">King Agamemnon wants you to destroy King Thyestes&apos; Wonder.</string>
		<string _locid="3571">Tear that Wonder down!</string>
		<string _locid="3572">During the brief time he was king, Thyestes apparently had a Wonder dedicated to himself. Knowing how well-liked he was, he also had a stout Fortress built to guard it. \n \nHa! What an attention wench. \n \nFind that Wonder and tear it down. I want nothing built by King Thyestes left standing.</string>
		<string _locid="3573">Travel to the sacred mountain and build a Temple atop it.</string>
		<string _locid="3574">Please let me know as soon as the Temple is complete.</string>

		<string _locid="3578">Travel to the nearby villages and convert Villagers with your Priests.</string>
		<string _locid="3579">Have you finished converting the Villagers yet? Where did I put those pamphlets...?</string>
		<string _locid="3580">Some of the outlying villages still live in ignorance, unaware of the gods. We must convert them, though we should expect some to cling to the old ways. \n \nTravel forth and convert at least 12 Villagers.</string>
		<string _locid="3581">Gather some Gold and build Temples where the enemy villages once stood.</string>

		<string _locid="3589">Now that we have the means to construct a tremendous structure, we should travel to one of the highest peaks and build it in honor of the gods.

		<string _locid="3700">With the Stables gone, we can build up right outside the city. While Herculos proceeds, I call upon you for a most daring task. \n \nI am sure Thyestes will send his troops to try and stop us, and we will use that against him. My scouts will lead you to a perfect spot for an ambush. Destroy Thyestes&apos; reinforcements, and his soldiers will question fighting for him.\n \nI can&apos;t spare many troops to assist you, but I will give you plenty of resources to rapidly speed up your efforts. Use them wisely!</string>
		<string _locid="3702">Herculos&apos; men surround Mycenae, but to attack Thyestes in my own home city would be folly. We need a clever distraction... Once again, we need you.\n \nLead a raid against the farming outpost that supplies most of his army&apos;s food. Hungry men will think twice in supporting a false king.\n \nHerculos will provide you with some Battering Rams. Use them to wreck the enemy buildings, but be sure to protect the rams against infantry and cavalry.</string>

They also took me children, Elpis and Hesiod, to raise among their kind. \n \nYar. I cannot stand to think of me wee ones growing up to be such as them.

		<string _locid="3863">Ah! Up for a challenge?\n \nSmall outposts might be able to rely on forage for food, but you&apos;re not going to feed an empire on berries.

		<string _locid="4195">Defeat the Sea People with the help of the Egyptian Admiral&apos;s troops.</string>
		<string _locid="4197">Thank you for rescuing me. I was guarding cargo ships for the Pharaoh, but those Sea People attacked and scattered us to the winds. I have to push them back and retrieve what we lost. \n \nIf you help me get it all back and hurt our enemies, the Pharaoh will reward you handsomely. I&apos;ll send some troops along to help you out.</string>

		<string _locid="4207">All your Food arrived safely. That&apos;s good eatin&apos;!</string>
		<string _locid="4208">After all these attacks, we&apos;re going to need a lot of Food to keep the people of Argos from going hungry.

		<string _locid="4209">We won&apos;t go hungry with the stockpiles of Food you&apos;re bringing in. Head out and gather a bunch more, and I&apos;ll make sure it gets back to Argos.\n \nYou&apos;ll run into resistance, so don&apos;t forget to keep defenses up or an army on hand.</string>
		<string _locid="4210">If Argos is to survive the next attack, we&apos;re going to have to construct our buildings out of stronger materials.

		<string _locid="4211">All of the Stone you&apos;ve gathered will help out a great deal.</string>
		<string _locid="4212">My ships are ready to haul back any Stone you gather.</string>
		<string _locid="4213">The Sea People&apos;s attacks have depleted our Wood supplies. Gather some for the cause.\n \nWood is not scarce, but you can still run into other people who want it as bad as we do. Once you have enough, I&apos;ll make sure it all gets back to Argos.</string>

		<string _locid="4843">During my bi-daily audit of the Capital City, I learned that sloth is on the rise. Unacceptable! The people claim that working in such a drab and weary city has affected their production. Obviously, we cannot let this stand.\n \nI contacted a trader in Nubia who is willing to provide our much-needed beautification, but we must provide him our aid first. Travel to Nubia and get the trader&apos;s help. I will attempt to increase production here the only way I know how.</string>
		<string _locid="4845">It is good to see you arrive! I am a trader and little else. I have no skill for leadership or combat, but I know how to bargain for it.\n \nYou see, the Badari razed my home village, stole the wares I was storing there, and took my family to press into labor.\n \nI have the blueprints you need for your Capital City, and you have the skills I need to restore my village. It is a fair trade, right?</string>
		<string _locid="4852">Travel to the Greek city of Argos, and speak with the Argos Captain.</string>
		<string _locid="4853">Ah, the Sea People. Don&apos;t get me started. They are raiding the entire countryside. Refugees are pouring into the city from all the lands around Argos. We could definitely use your help.</string>
		<string _locid="4855">We have heard that the Sea People are not attacking only us. They appear to threaten everything along the Mediterranean and Aegean!\n \nYou have been granted passage to the city of Argos, where a large-scale defense is being mounted.

		<string _locid="4861">Defend Egypt!</string>
		<string _locid="4863">Mycenae is under attack! \n \nThe scouts have reported that the enemy is not the Followers of Autolycus, Trojans, or any force we have ever seen before. They are a massive force that came from the sea in many ships. \n \nProtect the Palace. If it falls, we will lose Mycenae to these strangers.</string>
		<string _locid="4871">Excellent! I think we gained a bit of time on the schedule.</string>
		<string _locid="4872">Do not dawdle. You are wasting not only my time, but the time of both of our generals.</string>
		<string _locid="4879">This oasis is wonderful! I was so concerned for my lotus collection out here.</string>
		<string _locid="4880">This desert is terrible! I miss the beauty of the papyrus reeds.</string>
		<string _locid="4883">The Badari are charging! Man the walls! Defend the lotuses!</string>
		<string _locid="4885">My men and my collection thank you. Let us weather this storm and watch the Badari twist in the wind.</string>
		<string _locid="4921">Excellent raid! Less food in Badari bellies and more food in ours!</string>
		<string _locid="4935">Excellent, the Prince Aha is safe.</string>
		<string _locid="4936">Shhhhhhhhhhh! Do not wake the sleeping Prince Aha.</string>
		<string _locid="4937">Follow Prince Aha on his &quot;walk&quot; and protect him.</string>
		<string _locid="4938">The Sleepwalking Prince Aha</string>
		<string _locid="4939">Although Sesostris has left Libya, his brother Aha remains. And even here, far from the heart of Egypt, assassination attempts are a constant threat to members of the royal family.\n \nTo make matters worse, Prince Aha has a tendency to walk in his sleep. I am very worried about him, but waking him could be disastrous. You will have to defend him while he takes his &quot;walk.&quot; \n \nFollow the prince with a small group of bodyguards and make sure he gets back alive. If you&apos;re lucky, he might heal your men and fight while he is sleeping. Then again, he might just dance like a chicken and run off into the reeds.</string>
		<string _locid="4943">Thank you, good sir. I don&apos;t know what Prince Aha would do without you.</string>
		<string _locid="4948">Prince Aha continues to sleepwalk around the oasis!\n \nYou will need to protect him once more if the royal family is to remain safe and sound.\n \nWith a small group of guards, follow Prince Aha and keep him alive. As before, if you&apos;re lucky, he might heal your men and fight while he is sleeping. Then again, he might suddenly wake up and charge into the assassins!</string>
		<string _locid="4951">Thank you! I am certain this is the last time you will need to protect the sleepy Prince Aha!</string>
		<string _locid="4954">Find and rescue the First Mate.</string>
		<string _locid="4956">My First Mate needs to be rescued.</string>
		<string _locid="4957">Excellent! I was afraid I&apos;d have to find someone to replace the First Mate.</string>
		<string _locid="4958">Overboard!\n \nThe First Mate of my flagship went overboard in a horrendous storm that sent us off course. He is a strong swimmer and I know the island he was near.\n \nWithout a doubt, he is being held hostage in a town to the north. I owe it to him to try to arrange a rescue.\n \nWill you assist?</string>
		<string _locid="4960">Land and build a base on the island of your choice, and then defeat all enemies.</string>
		<string _locid="4961">No one is safe where you are about to go. Everyone controls a different island, and they all want to control ALL the islands. \n \nWe do too, and you&apos;re the one who can make that happen. The only way to take full control will be to defeat all the enemies. But you&apos;ll have some help. They&apos;ll fight one another, given a chance. Don&apos;t be afraid to allow them to bloody one another without you.</string>
		<string _locid="4962">Prince Aha Must Survive</string>
		<string _locid="4963">Prince Aha Safe</string>
		<string _locid="4964">There are so many pirates around here!\n \nFirst a horrendous storm, now these pirates that are attacking anything that sails near. Come with me, and we will make these waters safe for Egyptian ships.\n \nMy charts say that there are several islands in the region. The pirates are likely based on one or more of them. We should build a base of our own, and then gouge evil from its shell!</string>
		<string _locid="4976">Once again, the Badari have taken control of a river crossing vital to our commerce and supply. If we can defeat their War Leaders, we can retake this crossing ourselves.\n \nGo now and take these War Leaders down!</string>
		<string _locid="4977">Those Badari War Leaders still threaten the Nile!</string>
		<string _locid="4978">Kill the Badari War Leaders at the river crossing.</string>
		<string _locid="4979">You did well with the last bunch of Badari War Leaders. But several must have snuck away and begun training Slingers in key locations along the Nile. \n \nOne of these places has been spotted. Strike quickly!</string>
		<string _locid="4980">To keep our control over Upper Egypt, you must destroy those Slinger Training Camps and the War Leaders responsible for creating them.</string>
		<string _locid="4986">Let&apos;s see, I do all the thinking, and you do all the work. So why are you talking to me? Go fortify the pass!</string>
		<string _locid="4988">Oh, it&apos;s just you. I was expecting someone... important.\n \nWell, perhaps you do possess the skills needed to assist in several of the more menial tasks that fall under my vast jurisdiction.\n \nIt might be a bit of a stretch for you, but you will need to construct fortifications along the mountain pass. Without defenses, the Nubians will surely return.\n \nSo, do run along, fortify the pass, and stop the Nubians.</string>
		<string _locid="4993">Interesting, you almost did a good job this time. I am... not disappointed.</string>
		<string _locid="4994">You seem to be under the impression that the tasks I give you are optional. Go fortify the mesa!</string>
		<string _locid="4995">Fortify the mesa and survive the enemy attacks until time runs out.</string>
		<string _locid="4999">Protect the Ancient Fort until reinforcements arrive.</string>
		<string _locid="5001">The Ancient Fort must be held!</string>
		<string _locid="5002">You appear to have not entirely done poorly this time. I thank you.</string>
		<string _locid="5003">Ancient Fort Must Survive</string>
		<string _locid="5006">Free the Egyptian forces and use them to take control of the Gold fields.</string>
		<string _locid="5007">Survive and mine Gold.</string>
		<string _locid="5008">The Egyptian Treasury needs Gold!</string>
		<string _locid="5009">The Egyptian Treasury grows once more.</string>
		<string _locid="5011">In some areas of the Nile, the fishing is great. However, the best area has two problems. One, every enemy we have knows about it. Two, the area is so rocky that farming is useless, and you can&apos;t find other animals to hunt.\n \nI need you to go there and get control over that part of the Nile. You should be able to bring back a large quantity of Food if you control the water.</string>

		<string _locid="5076">How many Pyramids do we have now... six? Nice!</string>
		<string _locid="5093">You have been a great boon to my father, the Pharaoh. Let us band together to unify Egypt under our name.</string>
		<string _locid="5098">Do not try my patience; you will see it is sorely lacking.</string>
		<string _locid="5101">The pass is clear, and these Badari defenses will no longer claim the lives of our people. Let&apos;s go!</string>
		<string _locid="5102">Do not waste my time nor the efforts of the villagers who built these Siege Towers.</string>
		<string _locid="5109">Recapture the War Elephants and destroy the Badari Siege Workshops.</string>
		<string _locid="5112">These are fine beasts! They recognized you were their master right away.</string>
		<string _locid="5113">We cannot let this opportunity pass us by!</string>
		<string _locid="5127">The Badari are no more! Upper and Lower Egypt are one under the divine reign of Narmer!</string>
		<string _locid="5128">The unification of Egypt is in your grasp!</string>
		<string _locid="5138">It is good to see you again, friend. Let this mark the beginning of our new campaign.</string>
		<string _locid="5139">I hope I will see you in Nubia.</string>
		<string _locid="5142">These fools will learn the true value of gold when we trample their villages.</string>
		<string _locid="5147">Are you not the sneaky sort? That is disappointing.</string>
		<string _locid="5154">Cross the Great Divide and defeat the Nubians.</string>
		<string _locid="5155">Get a move on. We really need control over that big ditch!</string>
		<string _locid="5157">The Nubians march into a trap. Spring it!</string>
		<string _locid="5158">Set up defenses and destroy the Nubian army.</string>
		<string _locid="5180">Build a Temple of Ra and train 20 Spearmen before time runs out.</string>
		<string _locid="5182">Enemies Killed</string>
		<string _locid="5186">Alexandria is under attack! Invaders have landed in the Nile Delta and threaten the jewel of the Egyptian empire. \n \nThey sent no diplomat, and they come from no foreign empire we know. They greeted us with swords and arrows.

		<string _locid="5280">I have come to you because you are the only person I can trust to accomplish my dream: the unification of Egypt.\n \nA nearby outpost has fallen to Badari raiders who have rejected the idea of joining us. Clear them out so our people may grow and become prosperous.</string>
		<string _locid="5284">Congratulations! Your very efficient leadership has brought our people into a new Age!\n \nOur wise men are bursting with new ideas, and with your guidance, we will unify Egypt faster than I had dreamed of! \n \nTell our wise men what technologies you wish to have. With that power, there will be no stopping our advance.</string>
		<string _locid="5285">This is what I get for trusting a lesser commander... An Egyptian expeditionary force was defeated and captured as they made their way to capture the Gold fields near Napata. \n \nI need you to fix this mess.

		<string _locid="5329">It is about time you helped me out! There is much work to be done, so pick up that oar and get to it! \n \nThe Badari are dropping their filthy nets into my waters and making off with my precious fish! I need you to get out there, sink those ships, and burn their Docks. That&apos;ll teach them!</string>
		<string _locid="5330">Those Docks aren&apos;t going to burn themselves down!</string>
		<string _locid="5331">That was a good day&apos;s work. Share a fish with me.</string>
		<string _locid="5333">Up for more work? The Badari are sneakier than I thought. \n \nWe razed their fishing camp, but there are several small Badari villages on the edges of the Nile. It will take some effort, but root out these towns before they pollute our waters any further.</string>
		<string _locid="5334">Nicely done, but the work is not finished. There are more camps to burn.</string>

My friend Advising Commander Herculos of Sicyon will provide you with a few highly trained Phalanxes.\n \nYou will serve as the front-line leader.

		<string _locid="5639">Nomad Trader</string>
		<string _locid="5640">With the small army provided by General Ahapitep, recover the outpost and clear the desert trading route.</string>
		<string _locid="5644">The leaves rustle with fear. There is a sandstorm coming that will cripple any forces caught out in the open.\n \nThe Badari we ousted from the Oasis Caravan Camp know they are in danger, and they are massing for an attack. They are desperate and will stop at nothing to retake the camp.\n \nWe cannot let them succeed. My lotus collection would be put to the flame!</string>
		<string _locid="5647">We have been tasked with clearing the western trade routes and pushing the Badari out to the open desert.\n \nLike a gentle lotus plucked from the fertile banks, the Badari will wither under the scorching sun. To begin, you must sweep away the Badari that have been raiding the local traders. Deal quickly with any Scouts and Guard Towers you encounter, and be sure to recover the abandoned outpost. Without the outpost, you will be unable to replenish your troops.\n \nBe careful! If you are ever without troops, you will fail.</string>
		<string _locid="5648">The first task is complete! The petals of the Badari horde are already wilting!</string>
		<string _locid="5649">Since we are moving away from the bounty of the Nile, we must make fertile ground for future expeditions. The Badari have retreated to an oasis, and its refreshing waters are an ideal place for us to take root.\n \nMake your army the scythe and cut down the weeds!</string>
		<string _locid="5652">Combine forces with the Medjay and defeat the Nubian enemies.</string>
		<string _locid="5654">It is not enough to build a large military to defeat the Badari. We must also be able to build it quickly. \n\nBuild a Temple of Ra and train Spearmen as quickly as possible.</string>
		<string _locid="5656">To defeat the Badari, we must become experts at quickly fielding an army.\n \nBuild a Temple of Ra and train Spearmen as quickly as possible.</string>
		<string _locid="5657">Excellent! We&apos;ve begun to demonstrate we have what it takes to defeat the Badari.</string>
		<string _locid="5658">I have a vision of an army rising from the ground so quickly that the Badari can do naught but tremble in their huts. \n \nBuild a Temple of Ra and train Spearmen as quickly as possible.</string>
		<string _locid="5660">Excellent! You are a master commander.</string>
		<string _locid="5661">You have done very well so far, but can you do it even faster?\n \nBuild a Temple of Ra and train Spearmen as quickly as possible.</string>
		<string _locid="5662">We must solidify the prominence of our Capital City.\n \nHow better than to build a symbol of our power right in the middle of several Badari villages. Expect resistance, as some Badari may revolt against you. But, once you finish, our hold on this area will be secured.\n \nI suggest you build some defenses around the construction site. I&apos;ve given you some extra Stone just in case.</string>
		<string _locid="5666">Pyramid Completed</string>
		<string _locid="5667">Complete construction of a Pyramid in the heart of the Badari lands.</string>
		<string _locid="5668">Complete construction of two Pyramids in the heart of the Badari lands.</string>
		<string _locid="5669">Complete construction of three Pyramids in the heart of the Badari lands.</string>
		<string _locid="5670">Are the Pyramids complete?</string>
		<string _locid="5671">Is the Pyramid complete?</string>
		<string _locid="5672">Ah, she&apos;s a beautiful Pyramid isn&apos;t she?</string>
		<string _locid="5674">Large Pyramid Completed</string>
		<string _locid="5675">Small Pyramid Completed</string>
		<string _locid="5676">Small Pyramids Completed</string>
		<string _locid="5679">Aren&apos;t Pyramids fun to build?</string>
		<string _locid="5683">All right, one last set of Pyramids and we&apos;re done... I promise! Complete construction of three more Pyramids among the Badari villages in the area. \n \nExpect more resistance. Unrest among the people is troubling, but these last sites will prove once and for all that we are the new rulers of these lands!</string>
		<string _locid="5684">The Badari lands were vast, and one Pyramid isn&apos;t enough to awe the locals. Complete construction of two more Pyramids among the Badari villages in this area.\n \nExpect resistance. Unrest grows among the people, but soon they will fall in line.</string>
		<string _locid="5687">Excellent work! But we must hurry. There are more Badari threats to fish out of the Nile.</string>
		<string _locid="5691">Unless we can clear those Guard Towers, our push to unify Egypt will be dead. Control the Nile and we control Egypt.</string>
		<string _locid="5692">The Greeks would call the Badari a hydra. Cut off one head and two grow in its place. Obviously, we must use two generals to cut off both heads! \n \nGenerals Ahapitep and Batoshipip have arrived from their campaigns in Nubia and Libya to do just that. They will guide you to where we must attack the Badari.</string>
		<string _locid="5693">While Ahapitep sweeps across the sands of the great desert, we will be like the noble catfish, skimming the Nile waters clean.\n \nThe Badari have a network of Guard Towers along the coast, and their arrows spear through our transports. Take some troops and clear the Guard Towers on the south side of the Nile; then our transports can make it through.</string>
		<string _locid="5694">The Badari Farms near the city of Khmun are swollen with food and ready to fill enemy bellies. Like the eel, we must be opportunistic about our next meal, robbing it in the dead of night.\n \nThis opportunity is too good to pass up. Raid their Farms, and we will use their food to strengthen our own armies! Be careful: Even if these are mere Farms, they are assuredly guarded.</string>
		<string _locid="5695">Strike, my precious eel! Destroy their Farms!</string>
		<string _locid="5701">Destroy the Badari Mystic Temples, and rescue the Chieftains who have been captured.</string>
		<string _locid="5704">As hoped, the Nen-Nesu have agreed to our alliance. Let the Badari fear the coming flood of our power.</string>
		<string _locid="5705">Swell and flood the Badari outpost, crash down their Mystic Temples, and carry the Chieftains to freedom!</string>
		<string _locid="5708">As the mullet band together to better their odds, so must we form an alliance.\n \nThe Nen-Nesu are a strong and loyal people. If we can earn their respect, they will aid us in the coming battles.\n \nTo do so, you must rescue their captured Chieftains, and while there, destroy the Mystic Temples the Badari have built in the middle of their most fortified Nile outpost.\n \nSuch a bold move will earn the respect and loyalty of the Nen-Nesu.</string>
		<string _locid="5711">Nen-Nesu Chieftains Rescued</string>
		<string _locid="5712">Sesostris Must Survive</string>
		<string _locid="5716">Prince Sesostris is young and can be impatient. Have you spoken to him yet?</string>
		<string _locid="5717">My son, Prince Sesostris, has been very insistent of late. He is a fine young man, ambitious and hopeful, but he is not the most efficient prince. That will come with age and experience.\n \nSesostris wishes to lead an army to finally defeat the Badari and unify Egypt. His plan has merit, and while doting is not very productive, I cannot help but dote on my eldest son.\n \nHelp my son as you helped me, and all of Egypt will be ours.</string>
		<string _locid="5719">Ahapitep and Batoshipip are good men, but both take their time in battle. The Badari are a blight that must be ripped out quickly and with all the force we can muster.\n \nI wish to lead a glorious charge into the heart of the Badari, and I secured the best Camels in the land to do just that. However, the merchants transporting the Camels foolishly let themselves be captured.\n \nJoin me in securing the Stolen Camels and in slaughtering the Badari in our way.</string>
		<string _locid="5720">These Camels should be more than enough to help us reach our next location. Onward!</string>
		<string _locid="5722">I apologize for the delay, my friend. Our scouts have reported that the pass ahead is well-defended with Guard Towers. They will surely end our efforts if we advance carelessly.\n \nI took the initiative and ordered the locals to construct a small group of Siege Towers. If you provide them ample defense, they will crush every wall and tower as though they were aged papyrus left to fade in the desert sun.\n \nUse the Siege Towers and clear the way for our troops to advance!</string>
		<string _locid="5723">Use the provided Siege Towers to break through the enemy lines. Destroy all the Guard Towers.</string>
		<string _locid="5726">General Ahapitep&apos;s march ran into a snag. He left with a force of War Elephants, but they were captured under the cover of a sandstorm. Foolishness!\n \nThe Badari took the War Elephants to a siege camp. Let us kill two birds with one pachyderm.\n \nTake a small force and recapture our War Elephants, then use them to smash the Badari siege camp. Be somewhat careful: We still need enough War Elephants for our attack on the Badari capital.</string>
		<string _locid="5730">My father possesses the white and red crowns of Egypt at last. He is sated, but I know we are capable of so much more.\n \nIf you follow the Nile south, you soon enter Nubia. We frequently trade with the native Medjay, but the other Nubians do not look kindly on us. In light of that, we will use the Medjay to defeat the other Nubians.\n \nI know the fires of conquest burn in you. Join me and we will make an empire that will withstand the test of time!</string>
		<string _locid="5731">Visit the Nubian Expedition and Talk to Prince Sesostris\n</string>
		<string _locid="5732">Visit Libya and Talk to Prince Sesostris\n</string>
		<string _locid="5733">Return to Your Capital City and Talk to Prince Sesostris\n</string>
		<string _locid="5740">Yes, yes, that seems adequate. But they have stronger Citadels farther downriver.</string>
		<string _locid="5743">Yes, it would seem we need an even more impressive demonstration of the Nubian Citadel weaknesses.\n \nAs before, destroy a Nubian Citadel as fast as you can. But this time, do it a little faster, okay?</string>
		<string _locid="5746">The Pharaoh is nearly convinced. If you could destroy one more Citadel, it would end the debate.\n \nSpeed is of the essence. Any delay will ruin my expert plan.</string>
		<string _locid="5748">Incredible! My idea was a success! And you actually did a good job.</string>
		<string _locid="5750">My plan worked flawlessly, again! And as for you, well, I am grateful you did not fail.</string>
		<string _locid="5751">Nubia is swollen with Gold, and it is used frivolously in petty baubles. I want to use it to build an army to crush our enemies. A place called the Golden Punch Bowl is nearby and is ripe for the taking.\n \nGo and take control of the Golden Punch Bowl. We can put such wealth to better use in the fight for upper Nubia.</string>
		<string _locid="5752">Gather as much Gold as possible, before time runs out.</string>
		<string _locid="5753">Sneak through Aswan and meet with the Desert Trader.</string>
		<string _locid="5754">I have heard rumors of a man known as the Desert Trader who swears he is vital to our expedition. The problem is he isn&apos;t welcome in certain cities leading to lower Nubia. Neither are we, really.\n \nHe is outside of Aswan now, and the safest way to get to him would be to send three Priests to meet him. \n \nSneak through the city and reach the Desert Trader. Once he is under our protection, there should be no problem getting out.</string>
		<string _locid="5755">I see you secured the Desert Trader. He better pray that he is as useful as he boasts.</string>
		<string _locid="5763">The Great Divide blocks our movement south. It is a large ditch with several small bridges across, making it a nightmare to assault. But assault we shall!\n \nSeveral Nubian tribes have banded together to guard the bridges, but that only means more battle and more glory.\n \nBuild up forces on one side of the Great Divide, and then cross and conquer the other side.</string>
		<string _locid="5764">The Nubians have heard of our victories at the Great Divide, and they are sending a massive force to a village in Echo Canyon. What foolishness! Echo Canyon is well-supplied and a defender&apos;s dream.\n \nPrepare a defense and slaughter them all. When you pull this off, you open the way for us to take Lower Nubia for Egypt!</string>
		<string _locid="5765">I have allies preparing to attack the Nubians, but they are not nearly as useful as you. I need you to be my ace in the hole.\n \nI am giving you a small navy with all the materials you need to construct a base. Land out of sight, grow your forces, and devastate our foes with a combined assault.\n \nThey&apos;ll never know what hit them!</string>
		<string _locid="5766">Land your forces, build a base, and then defeat all enemies.</string>
		<string _locid="5767">Greetings, I&apos;m General Chafre, and I am now overseeing our conquest of Nubia. Our prince likes to do things with his own hands, but he forgets that there is help around every corner. The Medjay are good warriors who know the land and the way of our enemies. Their price is high, and we do not have much time to acquire the funds, but I heard great things about you. \n \nTravel to the nearest Medjay village, gather Gold, and tribute it to them to secure their loyalty.</string>
		<string _locid="5768">Travel to the nearest Medjay village and tribute them Gold.</string>
		<string _locid="5770">The city of Napata sits near a number of Gold fields, making it a critical location for us and our enemies. Let&apos;s put the Medjay to good use.\n \nOur new friends will draw the attention of Napata&apos;s defenders while you build up to crush them. Be swift. The Medjay can only do their job for so long, and I would like to minimize their losses.</string>
		<string _locid="5771">The City of Napata is beside Gold fields we need to control. Go and secure it for me.</string>
		<string _locid="5773">The Nubians, being local, have well-established villages. Sleepy villages make for prime targets.\n \nThere are a pair of villages supplying the military in the area, and despite their importance, they are barely defended. I want you to raid them under cover of darkness so we can starve our enemies.\n \nGet in, kill the Villagers, and get out fast. Guards will rush in if we delay.</string>
		<string _locid="5778">The guards we attracted by attacking the smaller villages left two cities wide open. Our window of opportunity is small. We must press on.\n \nThe Medjay will take a while to arrive with reinforcements, but it will be worth it. Build up your forces and then join the Medjay reinforcements to destroy the Nubian Town Centers.</string>
		<string _locid="5780">Excellent. The Nubians cannot take much more of this!</string>
		<string _locid="5781">Hold on until reinforced, and then destroy both Nubian Town Centers.</string>
		<string _locid="5783">Gold Tributed</string>
		<string _locid="5791">Fight your way to the pass, destroy the Fortress, and seize control of the Pyramid.</string>
		<string _locid="5792">Adventure?</string>
		<string _locid="5794">You are invincible! And even the stodgy Vizier will be satisfied with so much treasure. Although, I still have no idea what he wants to do with it...</string>
		<string _locid="5799">And the Caravans are away! Let&apos;s see if we can do something about the Libyans.</string>
		<string _locid="5802">I must have guards for the Caravans.</string>
		<string _locid="5803">Get at least one Caravan to the road home.</string>
		<string _locid="5806">The Vizier, an aide to the Pharaoh, sent a messenger with a request. The nerve of him, bothering us with his frivolities while we are doing real work! \n \nGold is difficult to come by here, but we are near a friendly Medjay town. We can send several Caravans to trade for Medjay Gold to get the absurd amount the Vizier wants.\n \nDoubtless, Nubians will try to raid our Caravans. At least that will be fun.</string>
		<string _locid="5807">Use Caravans to trade with the Medjay Ally to accumulate as much Gold as possible.</string>
		<string _locid="5808">That should sate that greedy Vizier for the time being.</string>
		<string _locid="5809">Get those Caravans in motion. We need a lot of Gold!</string>
		<string _locid="5811">The Libyans are putting up more of a fight than we expected. Since we&apos;re encountering resistance, it&apos;s time to do something about these pests. I have been thinking about brilliant stratagems we might use to defeat them in a clever manner, but their end result is boring. \n \nYou like elephants, yes? Everyone likes elephants. What do you think about training War Elephants to step on them?</string>
		<string _locid="5812">If elephants know how to do anything, it&apos;s stomping anything idiotic enough to be underneath.</string>
		<string _locid="5813">To win this battle for Libya, we will need those War Elephants.</string>
		<string _locid="5815">Train an army of War Elephants before time runs out.</string>
		<string _locid="5819">Treachery! An assassin made an attempt on my life while I slept. No one warned him I sleep with one eye open and five daggers in my belt.\n \nHe still carried his contract and blood money. The Gold came from the Pyramid we ransacked earlier for the Vizier, and this contract bears his mark! I will crush that greedy buffoon&apos;s head myself!\n \nWe must hurry back to Egypt and speak with my father. If the Vizier made an attempt on my life, we can be sure he will do the same to the Pharaoh!</string>
		<string _locid="5820">We were too late. My father&apos;s body was already cold. We could not save him, but the Vizier will not win this day.</string>
		<string _locid="5823">We need the support and blessings of the Priests to ensure that this does not erupt into a civil war.</string>
		<string _locid="5824">Fight your way through the town to the Temples to gain their support.</string>
		<string _locid="5825">Caravans Move Out in...</string>
		<string _locid="5826">Defeat the Vizier&apos;s forces.</string>
		<string _locid="5829">Vengeance is at hand. Any men loyal to the Vizier must be routed and chased from Egypt, and the Vizier himself cannot leave alive. \n \nThe villages near his camp have been swayed by the Priests, and while they cannot help us fight, they will report any movement made by our enemies.\n \nOur forces from Libya have not arrived, and we face an entrenched foe. Be careful, be successful, be brutal.</string>
		<string _locid="5830">Now this is just silly. You have proven that nothing can stop you in the Great Camel Gauntlet, but no one can get five Camels through in two minutes. It is impossible.\n \nStill, if you manage it, the rewards will be great! I will supply your Camels!</string>
		<string _locid="5831">I have never even heard of this happening! The challenge now is to get five Camels through in even less time.\n \nThe rewards will be great! I will supply your Camels!</string>
		<string _locid="5832">Now let&apos;s really test your skills.\n \nGo to the Camel Gauntlet, and try to get five Camels through in even less time.\n \nThe rewards will be great! I will supply your Camels!</string>

		<string _locid="6337">The caravans are returning to Kyrenia! I can make a living again!</string>
		<string _locid="6338">I am losing gold every day those renegades live!</string>
		<string _locid="6340">Defeat the renegades and kill the Renegade General.</string>
		<string _locid="6341">Cyprus has many men who have no fear of the law. Those men make it very difficult for men like me to do their jobs. A simple trader is just a walking bag of gold out in the wilds! \n \nA band of renegades have banded under a disgraced General, and they are robbing merchant caravans foolish enough to cross their path. If this continues, Kyrenia will have neither the gold nor the goods it needs to survive. \n \nI will use my funds to supply you with whatever mercenaries I can find. Defeat the renegades!</string>
		<string _locid="6354">Cyprus does not have the luxury of a large, unified navy. If you send trade ships out to the open sea, then you are merely throwing gold into the abyss. \n \nThe Egyptian port city of Tamiat is rife with pirates, and they prefer Cypriot ships over all others. These pirates keep bases near Cyprus, which is where you come in. \n \nBuild a navy and destroy those bases!</string>
		<string _locid="6355">It will take time for those dastardly pirates to rebuild. Help yourself to their spoils!</string>
		<string _locid="6356">King Minos Needs You!</string>
		<string _locid="6357">Even our fishermen dread going out to sea!</string>
		<string _locid="6358">Defeat the Tamiat Pirates.</string>
		<string _locid="6374">Enemy Town Centers Destroyed</string>
		<string _locid="6375">All Enemy Town Centers Destroyed</string>
		<string _locid="6376">A Team Town Center Must Survive</string>
		<string _locid="6383">Well done! Ledrai will be a fine staging point for further conquests.</string>
		<string _locid="6384">How goes your campaign?</string>
		<string _locid="6385">Good work. Ledrai is quiet for now.</string>
		<string _locid="6391">Impressive! Let us use the bounty of Lapithos to conquer all of Cyprus!</string>
		<string _locid="6392">How fares your campaign?</string>
		<string _locid="6393">Good work. Lapithos is quiet for now.</string>
		<string _locid="6395">I have bad news to report about Lapithos. A prominent copper merchant seeks to make Lapithos independent, and he is using his wealth to hire an army to do just that! \n \nHis men have taken over the old defenses and the Fortresses are back and stronger than ever. As long as the Fortresses stand, our supply line is cut. \n \nPlease take your army and destroy the rebellion!</string>
		<string _locid="6398">How goes the siege against Amathus?</string>
		<string _locid="6399">Amathus is yours! Push onward!</string>
		<string _locid="6400">Good work. Amathus is quiet for now.</string>
		<string _locid="6405">My spies report that all is not well in Amathus. A disgraced leader is using his silver tongue to convince the guards to rise up against your rule. \n \nLetting Amathus declare independence will put all of Cyprus in danger. They will strike out at their neighbors and bring the entire island to war! \n \nBring your army to Amathus and demolish the Fortresses that stand. Only you can stop this!</string>
		<string _locid="6410">The city of Teucer was no match for you! With Salamis under your control, it is time to expand your campaign!</string>
		<string _locid="6411">Is the kingdom of Salamis yours?</string>
		<string _locid="6412">Good work. Salamis is quiet for now.</string>
		<string _locid="6415">A hero is at his most dangerous when he is down but not out, and Salamis is exactly the same. \n \nA band of warriors are crying for independence, and they have retaken the old defenses of the city. If they are left alone, then the people of Chytroi and Kition will be in danger. \n \nPlease take your men and destroy those Fortresses!</string>
		<string _locid="6426">Cretins on the Coast! (DEMO)</string>
		<string _locid="6436">Welcome to Arsinoe and Cyprus. Your task is challenging, but together we shall succeed.</string>
		<string _locid="6445">Defense of Arsinoe</string>
		<string _locid="6446">My Ally 2</string>
		<string _locid="6447">My Ally 3</string>
		<string _locid="6451">We cannot let Arsinoe be taken by Salamis!</string>
		<string _locid="6462">Tamassos is rich in mines, and it guards them jealously. Take caution. \n \n The heart of Tamassos&apos; military is on an island in a lake, and it is supported by the villages nearby. These villages also protect the mines in the region. You must secure these mines if you hope to succeed. \n \nEach village guards a bounty of mines. Use them and build a force to crush the Fortresses to the north.</string>
		<string _locid="6466">With Paphos taken, we have all but secured our sovereignty in Cyprus.</string>
		<string _locid="6470">Amathus is well-known for its vast fields of grain and gentle sheep. The kingdom is dense and the people flourish under the blessing of Aphrodite. \n \nDo not let that fool you into thinking Amathus is an easy target. The city knows how to survive a siege. \n \nI know you have the cunning and might to make Amathus yours. Demolish the Fortresses and Amathus will bow!</string>
		<string _locid="6472">Powerful Kourion was founded by the men of Argos. I am sure you know their power. \n \nNot only do you face a strong foe, but you face one that has chosen an advantageous position. In order to reach the heart of Kourion, you must traverse a gorge lined with archers, towers, and catapults. \n \nUse the expansiveness of the coast to your advantage, and build an army that fears not the arrow!</string>
		<string _locid="6473">Lapithos prospers with sweet water, fertile ground, and mighty smelting furnaces. Its people know luxury, and its armies are well-supplied. \n \nLapithos will serve your armies well, but it will not be taken easily. It will be a straight fight, and the nearby villages will band together to repel you. \n \nUse their land against them and shatter their Fortresses!</string>
		<string _locid="6474">The kingdom of Salamis was founded by Teucer, a peerless archer from the Trojan War. It marks the first step of your campaign. \n \nYour camp is situated near enemy defenses, so please be careful moving forward. If you can find your way through or around the defenses, then I am sure Salamis will crumble. \n \nThis is where it all begins. Defeat Salamis!</string>
		<string _locid="6480">Excellent work. Speak with me again soon. I expect a letter from Philadelphos of Arsinoe, the city leader.</string>
		<string _locid="6483">I received a letter from Philadelphos of Arsinoe. They are very thankful for the defense of the town, but this will not stop Salamis from trying again. \n \nPhiladelphos says he has a plan to prevent future attacks and increase the power of our empire. It sounds like an offer we cannot refuse! \n \nTravel to Arsinoe and speak with Philadelphos. He will tell you his plan.</string>
		<string _locid="6484">Travel to Cyprus and speak with Philadelphos of Arsinoe.</string>
		<string _locid="6485">The kingdom of Kition is the work of the Mycenaeans. It is a rich port town, and the landlocked kingdoms go through Kition to sell their goods. \n \nOur target rests on a peninsula, accessible by small shallows on each side. Find a way to the peninsula and obliterate the Fortresses there. Let neither man nor god stop you!</string>
		<string _locid="6490">General Killed</string>
		<string _locid="6501">Cyprus Generals Killed</string>
		<string _locid="6503">Many people are happy that Cyprus has been unified under your empire! Their lives are peaceful, and they can focus on their homes and families without fear. \n \nUnfortunately, not everyone prospers under peace. The Cypriot military is bored, and that makes for an easy target. Rebellious factions are securing the aid of Generals and becoming more dangerous than ever. \n \nThese Generals have lost their way and will not return. Punish them!</string>
		<string _locid="6505">Have you found any more Generals?</string>
		<string _locid="6506">Thank you. We move ever closer to peace.</string>
		<string _locid="6507">Kingdoms Defeated</string>
		<string _locid="6508">Destroy the Fortresses and recapture Amathus.</string>

		<string _locid="6514">Destroy the Fortresses and recapture Lapithos.</string>
		<string _locid="6518">Destroy the Fortresses and recapture Salamis.</string>
		<string _locid="6523">Ledrai may seem quiet, but it is anything but quiet. A group of rabble-rousing Generals have gathered anyone who would listen to them, and they have rebuilt the ruined defenses of the land. \n \nAs long as those rebels control the Fortresses, your control of Cyprus is in jeopardy.  Rally your army and retake Ledrai!</string>
		<string _locid="6524">Destroy the Fortresses and kill the Generals to recapture Ledrai.</string>
		<string _locid="6525">Recapture the mines and destroy the Fortresses to recapture Tamassos.</string>
		<string _locid="6526">The people of Soloi take you for a fool. They assume that since they are so difficult to reach, you will never know of the rebellion growing in the city. \n \nThey have rebuilt their defenses against the terms of surrender and selected a General from amongst their ranks. It is an open challenge to your authority! \n \nEven though the journey will be rough, go to Soloi and put down the rebellion!</string>
		<string _locid="6527">Destroy the Fortresses and kill the General to recapture Soloi.</string>
		<string _locid="6530">Destroy the Fortresses and kill the Generals to recapture Marion.</string>
		<string _locid="6536">Ledrai may not be as populated as Paphos or Salamis, but it is just as important to take. We must secure the kingdom before they have the opportunity to call for reinforcements. \n \nLedrai&apos;s primary defenses rest along a drying riverbed.  Much of the land is barren except for whatever remains on the banks of the river. \n \nYou will be forced into conflict early. Destroy the Fortresses and kill the Generals to take Ledrai!</string>
		<string _locid="6539">Great Marion kneels! Rest tonight and celebrate your victory! Cyprus is yours!</string>
		<string _locid="6540">Soloi will be a test of your mettle. If you can pass its test, then I know that all of Cyprus can be yours. \n \nYou see, the kingdom rests in an area that is difficult to reach. It enjoys an open field that is accessible only through a treacherous mountain pass. Soloi will flood that pass with soldiers that seek your ruin. \n \nMake it through the pass and prepare yourself for open battle. But beware the General: he will do his best to stop you.</string>
		<string _locid="6547">The Argives of Kourion did not take their defeat well. After you smashed their Fortresses and armies, these rebels chose to rebuild both to spite you. \n \nIf you wish to maintain control of Cyprus, then there is no other choice but to put this rebellion down. Go to Kourion and quell the rebellion!</string>
		<string _locid="6548">Marion is a prosperous kingdom, and there are always people who wish to see it bow to no one. They have pooled their money to hire powerful mercenaries, ruthless Generals, and master masons. The Fortresses are rebuilt, and Marion is under their control. \n \nThis situation must be undone as soon as possible, and only your might can make it so. Travel to Marion, decimate their mercenaries, and demolish their Fortresses!</string>
		<string _locid="6553">Break through the enemy defenses and destroy their Fortresses to capture the kingdom of Salamis.</string>
		<string _locid="6554">Capture the kingdom of Soloi by crossing the mountain pass to destroy the Fortresses and kill the General.</string>
		<string _locid="6557">Destroy the Fortresses and kill the Generals to capture the kingdom of Ledrai.</string>

		<string _locid="6565">Capture the Gold and Stone Mines, and then destroy the Fortresses to capture the kingdom of Tamassos.</string>
		<string _locid="6566">Cross the shallows and destroy the Fortresses to capture the kingdom of Kition.</string>
		<string _locid="6567">Destroy the Fortresses and kill the Generals to capture the kingdom of Marion. Defeat Marion to control all of Cyprus!</string>
		<string _locid="6569">The island of Cyprus is a land of great beauty and wealth. Currently, it is controlled by twelve kingdoms that do little more than bicker and battle each other.\n \nThe city of Arsinoe has been a safe port for our people, but the city-state of Salamis has amassed an army at its walls. We cannot leave our ally to the swords of its enemies. \n \nTake an army aboard transports and depart for Arsinoe immediately. The city must not fall!</string>
		<string _locid="6571">Land your army on shore, build a Town Center, and quickly move to defend the city of Arsinoe.</string>
		<string _locid="6572">Kill Cyprus Generals.</string>
		<string _locid="6578">How goes the conquest of the Twelve Kingdoms ?</string>
		<string _locid="6579">Defeat the Twelve Kingdoms of Cyprus.</string>

		<string _locid="6625">Ha! Those Triremes sure got their sails clipped!</string>
		<string _locid="6626">Elite Triremes Destroyed</string>
		<string _locid="6627">Destroy Elite Triremes.</string>
		<string _locid="6628">Guardian Hippikons Killed</string>
		<string _locid="6629">After the Trojan War, Cyprus was flooded with Greek immigrants, led by Chytros. In order to make Cyprus your own, you must conquer the home of its founder. \n \nThe land is well settled, and the men know of your arrival. A company of powerful Hippikons blocks your way to the Fortresses. Beware the smaller villages, for they will surely mount a defense. \n \nDestroy the Fortresses, and Chytroi will have no choice but to bow to you!</string>
		<string _locid="6630">Defeat the company of Hippikons, and then destroy the Fortresses to capture the kingdom of Chytroi.</string>
		<string _locid="6634">A local band of rebel Hippikons has riled up the people of Chytroi. We must quell this insurgence before it threatens all of your holdings. \n \nYou must defeat the Hippikons in order to reach the Fortresses they also hold. \n \nDestroy the Fortresses to end the rebellion!</string>
		<string _locid="6635">Defeat the company of Hippikons, and then destroy the Fortresses to recapture Chytroi.</string>
		<string _locid="6637">This is the final battle, my friend! \n \nMarion is the last of the kingdoms, and it has seen what has happened to its sisters. Marion is rich in copper, gold, and wood, and it knows that a great and powerful army comes for it. It will use everything in its power to halt your advance. \n \nMarion will strike ceaselessly and its Generals will show no mercy. You must break through the wave and crush it without hesitation!</string>
		<string _locid="6638">It is a marvel!\n \nYour lowly eyes might fail to detect the majesty of its construction, but trust my superior understanding when I tell you: This is a treasure of an Ancient Fort.\n \nBut if it were to fall into enemy hands, it would quickly become a deadly threat to our control of the region.\n \nThis time you must do your very best. Protect the Ancient Fort until reinforcements arrive.</string>
		<string _locid="6639">For as far back as you can imagine, Egypt has been populated with the finest of skilled craftsmen. Your patronage will be critical to upholding these traditions.\n \nTo begin, you must first build a Crafting Hall. After that, you can select the Crafting Schools our people should focus on. Once you have selected your school, you can begin to create custom gear and items for the troops, or to trade to neighboring cities for Coin.</string>
		<string _locid="6640">The Vizier has requested that I lead an expedition to Libya. It is strange that he asks for money then sends me away from where we are already doing so well.\n \nThe Medjay will continue our work. For now, I must heed this buffoon whom my father holds dear. Meet me in Libya, and we will see what challenges await us.</string>
		<string _locid="6641">Accumulate 5000 Food using only fishing. </string>
		<string _locid="6642">It turns out getting treasure out of a Pyramid takes a lot of work! Caravans have been called to haul it all away, and they&apos;re being loaded as we speak.\n \nIt is very likely the Caravans will come under threat once they are fully loaded. You must protect them from anyone who is foolish enough to get in our way.</string>
		<string _locid="6644">A bit sub-par, but you did manage to at least finish the job. I, of course, take the lion&apos;s share of the credit. After all, the Nubians never expected my engineering genius!</string>
		<string _locid="6646">It would seem I must again stoop low and allow you to assist me.\n \nYou can, of course, thank me for this honor at any time.\n \nAs for the next task, we must begin construction on the nearby mesa. You will be outnumbered by the Nubian tribes in the area, so do all of that military stuff that prevents the enemy from getting through, and try not to fail.</string>
		<string _locid="6647">Kill as many Villagers as possible before time runs out.</string>
		<string _locid="6648">I fear this might never end, Prince Aha continues to sleepwalk around the oasis!\n \nUnfortunately, Sesostris has recalled most of the guards to assist in his latest military campaign, so you will need to make do with an even smaller group of guards.\n \nAs before, follow Prince Aha and keep him alive.</string>
		<string _locid="6649">The Badari have stolen the latest crafting shipments! Someone has to go out there and recover the Merchant Carts.</string>
		<string _locid="6650">The Vizier is dead, my father is avenged, and Egypt is together as one. You are the one to thank for all of this. One hundred parades in your honor!</string>
		<string _locid="6651">We have cleared the way to the Nubian heartland, and final victory is close. One last push, and they will bow down to our glorious Pharaoh.\n \nAgain, the Medjay will need time to build up their forces, so you will be their shield until then. When both of you are ready, smash through and burn all to the ground!</string>
		<string _locid="6652">Ra, Set, Ptah! I demand all these Priests entreat Horus in this hour. </string>
		<string _locid="6658">They may come back, but I know you will save us again.</string>
		<string _locid="6660">We can&apos;t get a single ship out to sea!</string>
		<string _locid="6667">A renowned General has abandoned his post to make some quick gold. As if these bandits were not bad enough! \n \nThis General leads his men with precision and guile, and his raids are driving me into debt. It will take an extraordinary army and a pile of gold to defeat him. \n \nI have hired a band of mercenaries to help you. Please save my business!</string>
		<string _locid="6668">I can&apos;t survive while these renegades are stealing my shipments!</string>
		<string _locid="6669">My shipments! My gold! Thank you!</string>
		<string _locid="6676">Tamiat Pirates</string>
		<string _locid="6679">The Tamiat Pirates are back and more powerful than ever! They&apos;re sinking every ship in the water. \n \nWe rallied a fleet of Triremes to scuttle their base, but they were destroyed as they were anchored in the dock. If we can destroy their base, then we will be safe again. \n \nPlease raise a navy and fight those pirates!</string>
		<string _locid="6683">Destroy the Enemy Town Center</string>
		<string _locid="6923">Priestess to Queen&apos;s Temple One</string>
		<string _locid="6924">There is an Ancient Temple Complex in the mountains nearby. The Priestesses say that sanctifying the place will earn us the blessings we need to defeat our enemies, but a pack of wild dogs has taken residence. The Priestesses are not warriors, so it falls to us to do the dirty work.\n \nBe warned: The Medjay village nearby is not under our control.</string>
		<string _locid="6926">Get those Priestesses to the temple complex and watch your back.</string>
		<string _locid="6927">Train Priestesses and escort them to the Ancient Temple Complex.</string>
		<string _locid="6928">Nubian Trader&apos;s Family</string>
		<string _locid="6929">You are doing well, but this is going to get more difficult. Are you ready?\n \nYour farming demonstrations are getting a lot of attention! More and more of your people are following suit and starting their own Farms. Your show has worked twice now, so let&apos;s see if you can get even more people farming by providing an even greater spectacle. \n \nVisit another village and build Farms even faster.</string>
		<string _locid="6930">Troy is ours now, but that pesky Paris has been secretly trying to amass champions to lead a new army. He has offered treasure to any elite soldier willing to join his ranks.\n\nHunt down any elite soldiers you come across to make sure Paris&apos; plans never get off the ground.</string>
		<string _locid="6935">Destroy the Fortresses and kill the Generals to capture the kingdom of Paphos.</string>
		<string _locid="6936">Destroy the Fortresses to capture the kingdom of Idalion.</string>
		<string _locid="6937">As you forge farther west, you will find far less friendly terrain. The mountains are as strong a defense as any wall, and you will surely encounter both. \n \nIdalion is prized for its copper, and flourishing trade has earned them much wealth. \n \nTheir defenses are rumored to be as confounding as the Labyrinth on Crete. They mean to use this network of walls to slow your men and expose them to the arrows of their Fortresses. \n \nCrush their walls and bombard their Fortresses!  </string>
		<string _locid="6938">The western kingdoms have no chance against your might.</string>
		<string _locid="6940">Paphos is a sacred land. It is the birthplace of Aphrodite, founded by the son of Pygmalion and his statue-wife, Galatea. The home of the goddess is blessed, and its defenders will fight tooth and nail to ensure that we do not mar its beauty. \n \nIn order to defend their assets, they have built a mighty Fortress near their mines and have positioned their most powerful Generals in the vicinity. \n \nBecause the mountains are not hospitable for crops, they have large fields in the valley below. Use all your guile to destroy the Fortresses and kill the Generals. Paphos&apos; treasure will be yours!</string>
		<string _locid="6941">Destroy the Fortresses to recapture Idalion.</string>
		<string _locid="6942">Destroy the Fortresses and kill the Generals to recapture the kingdom of Paphos.</string>
		<string _locid="6943">The people of Idalion no longer want to share its profits. If Idalion is left to its own devices, it will attack the other Cypriot kingdoms and foster a revolt. For the good of all of Cyprus, you must destroy their fortification. \n \nTravel to Idalion quickly, ascend the mountain, and tear down their Fortresses!</string>
		<string _locid="6944">There is a veneer of calm in Paphos, but something dangerous lurks below the surface. I consulted the oracle of Aphrodite, and she warned me that a rebellious faction sought her wisdom only a few days ago! \n \nThe rebels have gone to the countryside, terrorized the villagers into aiding their cause, and rebuilt the Fortresses that you razed. They have hired Renegade Generals to lead their revolt!\n \nGo to Paphos and bring ill fortune to these rebels!</string>

		<string _locid="7560">Wow, I guess you people really like those sacred tree things!</string>
		<string _locid="7561">I&apos;m sure Gyptis told me what those things are called before.</string>
		<string _locid="7564">As promised, here is the reward that was sent. Nice doing business with you.</string>
		<string _locid="7565">I hear your Druids sacrifice people. Is that true?</string>
		<string _locid="7566">Use a limited force to construct Guard Towers in the allied villages.</string>
		<string _locid="7567">You&apos;re pretty good at building in a pinch! I bet your Villagers can knock the most hardened Hypaspist out for hours. \n \nSome smaller Celtic tribes are being bothered by the Oxubii, and they asked Massalia for help. Normally, I would send a merchant there to arrange a price, but the Oxubii would cut his head off before he could even say hello. \n \nGo to the villages, build some Guard Towers, and defend them against Oxubii. In return, you can take whatever reward is given, minus a finder&apos;s fee.</string>
		<string _locid="7573">Gyptis found another gray hair this morning. This can&apos;t go on any longer! \n \nThe Oxubii homeland is guarded by three outposts. Each outpost supports a Fortress, and those Fortresses are your target. \n \nYou will be under pressure the moment you arrive, but I believe in you, your warriors&apos; huge muscles, and your scary, animal-sacrificing people! Obliterate those Fortresses!</string>
		<string _locid="7575">You did it! The way to the Oxubii is clear! What&apos;s that, Gyptis?</string>

		<string _locid="7653">Ha! I knew I could count on you. Tomorrow we will have a city-wide parade of all the carts you rescued. It will be huge!</string>
		<string _locid="7655">Have you seen the Merchant Carts?\n \nThey keep getting stolen, like clockwork, every single day. It&apos;s as if someone has made it their quest to steal the carts, hide them near some dangerous enemy camp, and then wait for someone like you to come along and bring them back, in a big, fancy demonstration of heroics.\n \nWell, any chance you can help out?</string>
		<string _locid="7657">Objective: Oxubii</string>
		<string _locid="7666">It would seem the Followers of Gaumata continue to rally despite his death and your continuous victories. A demonstration of wonder is in order!\n \nTravel to the outlands, find the most treacherous collection of enemy camps, and build the Gate of All Nations in the middle of the lot.\n \nYou will know the exact spot to put the Wonder when you get there.</string>
		<string _locid="7669">Weren&apos;t you going to do something about those Followers of Gaumata?</string>
		<string _locid="7670">Build a Wonder at the designated location before time runs out.</string>
		<string _locid="7671">With each Wonder, we improve upon our legacy of virtue.</string>
		<string _locid="7678">Survive and reach a total population of 200 before time runs out.</string>
		<string _locid="7682">You remind me of a story from my childhood.\n \nLong ago, there was a heroic war captain of Persia. Then he stopped doing what his empire needed him to do. The people revolted, and then there was a new war captain. The end.\n \nPerhaps there is a lesson you could learn?</string>
		<string _locid="7685">With our great numbers, no force will stand long in our way!</string>
		<string _locid="7688">Our lands are under threat!\n \nWandering Marauders have set up camps in the nearby valley. It&apos;s unclear what they want and even less clear the lands from which they hail. I call upon you to travel out, locate the enemy, and prepare a large force of our people to show our strength.\n \nIf they engage you in battle, be sure to defend yourself. You must impress them with your defenses and ability to marshal a large army while under pressure.</string>
		<string _locid="7693">Every man has his price.</string>

		<string _locid="7737">Distraction Action</string>
		<string _locid="7743">Your sneak attack worked swimmingly. The Aetolians ran like rabbits when they saw their homes burning. \n \nWe must take advantage of this opportunity before they return.

		<string _locid="7770">Those twice-cursed Barbarians have committed the greatest offense I know! You must exact my vengeance! \n \nI spotted their filthy nets sullying the pristine and sacred waters of the Rhone.

		<string _locid="7771">Day one of Docks burning: check.</string>

		<string _locid="7776">It looks like the Barbarians are starting to work together in order to keep you out of their business. Why don&apos;t you show them how useless that is? \n \nThe fishermen noticed a large Barbarian fleet on its way to our ally&apos;s Docks. If those Docks go down, that will leave our pals cut off and easy prey. \n \nWe have a few small encampments nearby. Use whatever you can to sink that fleet!</string>
		<string _locid="7778">Stand firm, fearless leader!</string>
		<string _locid="7779">Protect the ally&apos;s Docks from attack.</string>
		<string _locid="7780">Well done! No doubt they&apos;ll try again, but let&apos;s have a fish feast tonight!</string>

		<string _locid="7880">The fires are burning, and the chefs are waiting for the fish!</string>
		<string _locid="7881">Quickly gather fish.</string>
		<string _locid="7883">Look at all of those shining scales. I have to eat one now!</string>
		<string _locid="7885">You saved the day and my stomach!</string>
		<string _locid="7888">The Tribal Chief will not stop demanding these feasts! The Barbarians are still sinking my best ships, and it will take a miracle to get the fish on time. \n \nYou have to help me! She keeps asking for the impossible, and I don&apos;t know what to do. \n \nDo not let the Barbarians slow you down. Fish like my life depends on it!</string>
		<string _locid="7892">Darius will be most pleased with your successes! You are truly an ally of Persia.</string>

		<string _locid="7967">Messengers from the Village of Sens and Vindelicia arrived just moments ago. Both tribes want to negotiate alliances with us. The more united the Celts are, the better! \n \nYou will need to earn the trust of Brennos of the Senones and Drust of the Vindelicians. Go to their villages and help them as they would help us. Once you have their favor, we can finalize our alliances and build a powerful empire.</string>
		<string _locid="7968">Visit Vindelicia to speak with Drust and visit the Village of Sens to speak with Brennos. Earn their respect and favor so that your empire may grow.</string>
		<string _locid="7969">Hail and welcome to the Village of Sens! Before I can accept an alliance, I wish to see your prowess on the battlefield. \n \nYou have shown you are strong with the sword when you destroyed the Watch Towers earlier. I now wish to see you be the shield. \n \nBarbarians have settled by one of our outposts, and they are preparing to attack. Protect that outpost and defeat the Barbarians!</string>
		<string _locid="7970">Ally Town Center Must Survive</string>
		<string _locid="7975">You must defend the Village of Sens!</string>
		<string _locid="7976">I am relieved to see that the Village of Sens still stands. Drust will pay for his lies!</string>
		<string _locid="7979">Drust had you gather Gold so he could hire an army of Gaesatae, and then he used them to attack the Village of Sens. I do not know why he would do such a thing, but he is a traitor to the Celts. \n \nThe Senones are safe for the time being. In order to ensure the safety of Celtica, we must take the battle to Drust in Vindelicia. \n \nBe careful. Drust is sure to be surrounded by the best of his Gaesatae. Capture Vindelicia and save Celtica!</string>
		<string _locid="7995">My cousin loves what you have done, and he wishes to ally with us.</string>
		<string _locid="8001">If I find out who left their blade just outside my home, I will run them through with it.</string>
		<string _locid="8007">The trader confused you with Barbarians? What an idiot.</string>
		<string _locid="8015">There! Let&apos;s see the Greeks try to confuse us now!</string>
		<string _locid="8016">Persia needs you! Do not allow Gaumata to gain control of the empire.</string>
		<string _locid="8018">Look at all these weapons littering our streets. If anyone thinks this is how civilized people live, I will give them a black eye. \n \nHere is a blueprint for a Gear Hall. Once this is placed in your Capital City, you can equip your warriors with armor and weapons. Also, it will get all of this trash off the ground.</string>
		<string _locid="8019">It is good to see you. With your leadership, we will unite the tribes and become a civilization that is the envy of the world! \n \nWe are mighty, and we must use that might to protect those who cannot protect themselves. A nearby tribe is currently under assault by Barbarians. \n \nThose uncultured brutes will destroy everything if left alone. Go and slaughter them all!</string>
		<string _locid="8022">Excellent work. I will send word to Brennos.</string>
		<string _locid="8027">The Gaesatae performed wonderfully. Return to your village for now. I will send word later.</string>
		<string _locid="8031">The Barbarians are monsters, raiding and pillaging as they please with no concern for the consequences. Our neighbors are victimized daily! \n \nOne tribe lost all of their food when the Barbarians struck. There is no way they can survive the winter on their own. \n \nGo visit the tribe and hunt down every scrap of food in the area. Leave no beast alive!</string>
		<string _locid="8032">The tribe will starve without your help!</string>
		<string _locid="8036">It is up to us to save the tribes and make our civilization shine like a jewel. As long as the Barbarians live, they will oppose us at every turn. \n \nI tried to give them every opportunity to seek civilization and become good citizens, but there is just no saving them. If they only understand force, then give them force! \n \nRaise an army and obliterate their encampment. For civilization!</string>
		<string _locid="8037">The outpost is finished and the initial troops have arrived. This will be a true test of your skill. \n \nWe Celts are better suited fighting man-to-man rather than man-to-Fortress. You must learn how to defeat it, or else your enemies will always take advantage of your weakness. \n \nI will provide some Longbowmen to help with any defenders. Purge the Barbarians. Burn the Fortress!</string>
		<string _locid="8039">Our people are recognized by civilizations throughout the world, but they fear we are anarchistic marauders. One man is willing to give us a chance to prove our worth. \n \nYou remember the port town of Massalia, correct? Their leader, Protis, is asking for our help in keeping the peace. \n \nHelping him will restore order and secure a powerful trade ally. Remember to punch out anyone who opposes law and order.</string>
		<string _locid="8040">Something terrible has happened!</string>

How many has he tricked into believing that he is the son of Cyrus? How often has he sparked rally cries of rebellion? He is bold, dangerous, and mean. He has escaped justice until now. He has foolishly gambled that we would not catch him as he passed by the fortress of Sikayauvati.\n \nBe swift!

		<string _locid="8056">Since the death of Cyrus the Great, the struggle for leadership has brought much trouble to Persia! On one side, there is a man claiming to be Bardiya, son of Cyrus, and on the other side is Darius, a great hero of our people. I am but a humble trader and would normally not involve myself in the affairs of our leaders, but this man claiming to be Bardiya is an imposter! I know him to be Gaumata, a most cruel warlord.\n \nHis followers have set up camps nearby to train Magi at their War Academies.

To get back on schedule, we must eliminate the camps and their leaders.\n \nAdvisor Nekhbet of Nubia has provided a few elite Desert Swordsmen, Axemen, Slingers, and Triremes to aid our cause. Beat down all opposition!</string>
		<string _locid="8254">Mycenaean Treasurer Mogoadius wants you to travel to the hills where the city&apos;s Gold Deposits are located and gather Gold.</string>
		<string _locid="8256">The Vizier, for just an aide to the Pharaoh, seems to always need more gold. At least this gold comes with a little adventure.\n \nI have a map to a mysterious Pyramid filled to the brim with treasure. That is what the Vizier wants. Said Pyramid is guarded by a Fortress, and terrible guards determined to provide a great challenge. That is what I want!\n \nLet us take this Pyramid and send the Gold to the Vizier. He gets what he wants, and we get adventure!</string>

		<string _locid="8261">King Narmer is dead, betrayed by the Vizier. That jackal knew I would survive his trick, so he fled, protecting himself with men loyal to him.\n \nBefore I can challenge him in the open, I will need the support of the Priests from each of the Temples. For that, I need your help. We must visit all three Temples, and do so carefully. The Vizier&apos;s agents are sure to be looking for us.</string>
		<string _locid="8262">Good work - for a beginner. I could fish up eight times that in half the time, but I will beat that work ethic into you.</string>
		<string _locid="8268">Twelve Kingdoms squabble amongst themselves and throw smaller towns like my own into turmoil. \n \nI ask you to unite these kingdoms under your flag. Under one empire, their fighting will cease, and all people on Cyprus will live peacefully. Consider what Cyprus has to offer you--gleaming copper, verdant forests, fertile farmland, and a connection to mysterious lands far away!\n \nRally your armies and ride out.

		<string _locid="8594">Being an explorer, I see and hear many things in my travels. Out of all of my stories, one stands out before all others. \n \nEven though the Celts sacked Rome, not every member of that army made it back home. The Augur Augustus was a captive of Rome for many years, until one day the gods opened his cage and let him escape. \n \nThe only way home was across the Alps. Auggie would have to fight the harsh winter and all the dangers of the mountains.</string>

		<string _locid="8628">Do not allow the Barbarians to settle in our lands!</string>

		<string _locid="8631">The fates of Massalia, Celtica, and your empire hinge on this moment.</string>
		<string _locid="8632">This Advisor Hall is one more step toward becoming a flourishing civilization.</string>
		<string _locid="8633">You do not have to be alone when in the chaos of battle. There are many skillful men and women who will give you their knowledge. \n \nHere is the blueprint for an Advisor Hall. Once this is built in your Capital City, you may invite Advisors to aid you in your future campaigns.</string>
		<string _locid="8636">I see them beneath the surface, just out of reach. Carp! I love their shimmering scales and glassy eyes. Every lake and river is teeming with these delicious fish. \n \nI really want one for dinner, but those brutish Barbarians have taken over the area. \n \nBuild Docks and Fishing Boats to gather the fish, and I will send some Swanships to clear out the Barbarians.</string>
		<string _locid="8637">They may not have fish, but Farms are still a precious gift from nature. There is a town that is running out of berries and deer, and some Farms would be of help. \n \nIf you can build the Farms, then they will eat like kings until the end of the world. \n \nRemember that Farms require a more advanced town, so you will have to Age Up first.</string>
		<string _locid="8638">Welcome to Vindelicia! Now get to work. \n \nThe Barbarians you drove from your land have decided to run amok through my Sacred Groves, and the Druids there were foolish enough to be captured. I told the Barbarians that I would pay their ransom, but that is just a clever ruse. \n \nGo in my stead and recover my idiot Druids.</string>
		<string _locid="8639">You can kiss this alliance goodbye if those Villagers waste any more time.</string>
		<string _locid="8641">It is good to see you again. With you by my side, we cannot fail.</string>
		<string _locid="8642">Gratitude is in order. Due to your efforts, I acquired enough Gold to obtain a more permanent solution to ... the Barbarians. \n \nAs a reward, I will allow you to use a small company of my newly hired Gaesatae for your last task. There is no need to thank me for this magnanimous gift. \n \nThe Barbarians defiled my Sacred Groves beyond all redemption. Defeat the Barbarians and cleanse the Sacred Groves with fire.</string>
		<string _locid="8644">Look at all these pelts. This meat will feed people for weeks! Good work.</string>
		<string _locid="8646">Our craftsmen were inspired in their dreams by Lugus, and they yearn to build a fantastic structure in his name. If it has been demanded by the god, then we must oblige. \n \nThere is a site that would be perfect for a Wonder, but the land is not uninhabited. Remove all defenders if you must, and then construct the Wonder.</string>
		<string _locid="8648">Food, Stone, Wood--it is all Gold in the end.</string>
		<string _locid="8651">Build Sacred Groves in the Vocontii villages. Join forces with the Vocontii to defeat the Oxubii.</string>
		<string _locid="8658">You would not believe the number of people who confuse brave and noble Celts with crass and craven Barbarians. One night, I interrupted my ballad to give a three-hour lecture about the vast differences between the two people. \n \nThe Celts for the Advancement of Cultural Agreeable Opinions was formed to promote favorable opinions of our people. CACAO is a leader in Greco-Celtic relations, especially in Massalia. \n \nOf course, we promote good relations with massive bribes. Would you be willing to help?</string>
		<string _locid="8663">We need a fish feast tonight, but the Scout reported that Barbarians are infesting the waters. Can you lend a hand? \n \nThe feast is just a few hours away, and we need a huge pile of fish in order to make everyone happy. I know it&apos;s last minute, but I believe in you!</string>
		<string _locid="8664">The Tribal Chief has organized another fish feast and tasked me with getting the fish. The problem is that those Barbarians are still prowling the waters! \n \nThe fires are already lit, and we&apos;re down to the last moments before the feast begins. I&apos;ll pay you whatever you like. Please help me get the fish!</string>
		<string _locid="8665">Help the Massalian Trader rebuild his village. Build Houses and upgrade the Town Center to Age II. Then build Farms and rescue his captured family members with your Transport.</string>
		<string _locid="8667">A messenger from the Village of Sens arrived moments ago saying they&apos;re under attack! The Vindelicians somehow hired a massive army led by Gaesatae and are using it to destroy the Senones. \n \nBrennos rallied a defense, but even he cannot survive this without aid. We cannot let Drust win. \n \nTake whatever forces we have and go to the Village of Sens. Save the Senones!</string>
		<string _locid="8669">Build a Market and use it to generate the Gold you will need for an army, and then defeat the enemy base.</string>
		<string _locid="8670">Congratulations! Your strong and orderly leadership has brought the Celtic tribes into a new Age! \n \nWe can now research technologies that were once beyond our ken. \n \nTell our men what technologies you wish to have, and they will do all that is in their power to make it so. Technology opens the way to power!</string>
		<string _locid="8671">Your Capital City is austere. Perhaps Spartan? I refuse to have our beautiful civilization compared to the Spartans. \n \nI contracted a merchant in Massalia, the Greek city to the south. He is willing to provide us with decorations for free, but we must help him with some trouble. Travel to Massalia and aid the merchant.</string>
		<string _locid="8672">Massalia is a symbol of the unity of the Greeks and Celts. They are two great civilizations that go great together.</string>
		<string _locid="8673">Help! Help! Barbarians are--hold on. \n \nForgive me, but you look very similar to the people who have taken my home and family. The Barbarians came in the middle of the night and set all I knew ablaze. I barely escaped, but those monsters have taken my friends and family to their camp across the river. \n \nPlease, use your might to save my village and rebuild what was lost. I will give you all that I have!</string>
		<string _locid="8675">How were the homes of the Senones and Vindelicians? I&apos;m sure ours are far better.</string>
		<string _locid="8678">Defenders of Filippopili</string>
		<string _locid="8679">As you well know, Vindelicia is swollen with Gold. Villagers work day and night to ensure the prosperity of all of our people. \n \nThe Barbarians you chased from the Sacred Groves tried to raid our Gold Deposits. They failed, of course, but many of the Villagers were injured in the conflict. \n \nInstead of wasting days waiting for the Villagers to heal, train a force of Druids to heal them. Beat the Villagers if they get out of line. Or if you just feel like it.</string>

		<string _locid="9079">We Greeks are the masters of making something out of nothing. Most of your kin are not so ... economically inclined. \n \nIf you want to survive in Massalia, you need to know how to use a Market. Markets let you exchange resources for Gold and then spend that Gold for more resources. \n \nThere is a fertile land to the north, full of forests and beasts. Turn the bounty of the land into cold, hard Gold.</string>
		<string _locid="9080">I see you met our local problem, the Oxubii. Their time is spent on making my hair go gray. \n \nFortunately, they aren&apos;t well-liked by the other Celtic tribes. The Vocontii will not ally with Massalia itself, but I am sure they will help a fellow Celtic tribe. \n \nShow them good will by building some of those fancy tree groves you have. That should get the Vocontii to rally with you against the Oxubii.</string>
		<string _locid="9081">Tylis is in a wonderful position, but it is surrounded by enemies.

Let&apos;s use that as the base of our new town.</string>
		<string _locid="9082">Work on the new town is proceeding well. Unfortunately, our success breeds new problems. \n \nThe Thracians noticed the sneaky moves you made earlier, and our new town is right in their sights. We are prepared for a defense, but let&apos;s do one better. \n \nHead to our new town and use it as the base of your operation.

The village was very difficult to reach, and the paths were infested with bandits. \n \nAuggie knew what he had to do. He rallied his friends, and they resolved to battle the Alps once again. They would save the village!</string>
		<string _locid="9098">I got in a tussle with a Thracian last night. I won, naturally, and he swore that some Thracian Horseman would avenge him. \n \nThis Thracian Horseman is supposed to be a powerful warrior who defends the land. There are many Thracians who have fallen in love with that legend, so they try to emulate their hero. \n \nGo show the Thracians that their legends cannot stand up to our might. Defeat as many Thracian Horsemen as possible!</string>
		<string _locid="9099">It takes a lot of effort and skill to make Celtic Charcoal. If you would like some, you will need to do a little bit of work first.\n \nThe only local source is at the end of a Marauder-infested river.

They might be able to lend you a boost of speed or some extra boats along your route.\n \nBe quick to act and quick to think; the Marauders are known to constantly change their obstacles and traps.

Nearby Aetolia has rallied an impressive army to shore up the defense. \n \nThe Aetolians are natives, and their towns are nearby.

		<string _locid="9103">Each year, the local Celts perform a ceremony to ensure a strong harvest. It is always a wonder to behold! \n \nThis year, the Oxubii were relentless in their raiding, and much of the land has suffered.

		<string _locid="9135">My husband does not understand how our people work. Protis thought that if the main defenses of the Oxubii were destroyed, that would force them to leave Massalia alone. \n \nInstead, the Oxubii are retaliating against Lattes, just outside of Massalia. They&apos;re trying to avoid you by going naval. \n \nPlease defend Lattes. Build Guard Towers, build a navy - just do what you can to sink the ships.</string>
		<string _locid="9151">Thank you for all of your efforts in Massalia. The Oxubii will not attack again anytime soon. \n \nA man named Brennos sent a message. He is proud that you did not rest on your laurels after Vindelicia, and he requests that you join him in Tylis. Just follow the Danube River west. \n \nGood fortune, my friend. No matter what, you are always welcome in Massalia.</string>
		<string _locid="9152">Did I forget to tell you about the outpost that is under attack? Sometimes I forget even the important things... \n \nI&apos;m sure that never happens to you.\n \nA nearby outpost has come under attack from a group of raiding Clubmen.\n \nAs your Village Elder, I advise you to defend the outpost and show the citizens of Greece that they are safe to settle new lands.</string>
		<string _locid="9155">Did I not read the hieroglyphics properly? You are Crocodile, right?\n \nYou are the only person I can trust to accomplish my dream: the unification of Egypt.\n \nA nearby outpost has fallen to Badari raiders who have rejected the idea of joining us.

		<string _locid="9157">Ah, there you are!\n \nIt is good to see you. With your leadership, we will unite the tribes and become a civilization that is the envy of the world! \n \nWe are mighty, and we must use that might to protect those who cannot protect themselves. A nearby tribe is currently under assault by Barbarians. \n \nThose uncultured brutes will destroy everything if left alone. Go and slaughter them all!</string>
		<string _locid="9159">These Barbarians have gone too far. If the Greeks are confusing us with them, the only solution is the complete and utter destruction of all Barbarians. \n \nHeadhunter Etain has located their home, and she has established a base camp just out of their range.

		<string _locid="9253">Masterfully done! Our Craftsmen will be pleased to hear that their raw Gold is safe.</string>
		<string _locid="9254">Craftsmen of great skill are always looking for more raw materials to practice their art. Unfortunately, the skill of an artisan rarely lends itself to warfare. Some of our master Craftsmen are in such constant need of Gold that they regularly send out expeditions to acquire more. Naturally, where there is Gold, there are bound to be unscrupulous types. Our Craftsmen worry that without leadership, the mercenaries they have hired will be unable to protect the expedition. They are willing to part with some of their finest wares in exchange for your protection.</string>

That is when you strike!</string>
		<string _locid="9340">There are just too many pirates! Even worse, they have too many of those big ol&apos; Elite Triremes.\n \nCould you help out? Isn&apos;t it time to trim some Triremes?</string>

Their troubles are not over! \n \nIf we want the ceremony done in time, we must find a way to get the materials the craftsmen need. \n \nWe need your skills once again. Get as much Stone as you can. Be wary: the Oxubii are in the area.</string>
		<string _locid="9345">Boars are sacred to us Celts for good reason. They are mighty fighters when confronted, and no feast is complete without a roasted Boar on the table. \n \nSpeaking of feasts, I received a request for a mountain of Boars for the feast celebrating your victories. I&apos;m sure you don&apos;t mind helping, right? \n \nIf you provide half of the Boars, I&apos;ll pay you for the trouble.</string>

Now that you&apos;ve defeated the Oxubii, that competition is knocking on Massalia&apos;s gates! \n \nI believe the ones attacking Massalia are the legendary Sea People, terror of all coastal cities. If they are not dealt with swiftly, then Massalia will never know peace again. \n \nRally your forces and defend Massalia!</string>
		<string _locid="9348">Those sneaky Thracians won&apos;t leave us be. We must resort to drastic measures to keep Tylis&apos; connection to Celtica. \n \nThe Thracians hired Athenians to construct powerful siege engines. If we do not destroy their siege camps, we will lose our new town. \n \nI fear no man will return from this mission. Destroy the siege camp and die knowing you have secured our future.</string>
		<string _locid="9350">The bridge that crosses the Spercheios has been destroyed. We need a way to rebuild it before going farther. \n \nAuggie the Augur has graced us with his presence. He is confident that he can convince the Greek Villagers to gather the Wood we need. \n \nOnce you have gathered enough Wood, they will load up a Caravan. Get the Caravan to safety, and we will have bridges in the morning.</string>

		<string _locid="11247">A messenger reports that the Medians dance with joy to have their hands on our Siege Towers! Great work!\n \nPlease let Governor Zopyrus know that a new Median alliance has begun! You should probably tell the Port Master too, but she seems to be in a stormy mood.</string>
		<string _locid="11255">Since the times of Cyrus, many dangerous men have come from the lands of Media. Makru is not the first, nor will he be the last.</string>

		<string _locid="11283">General Zu, What Did You Do?</string>
		<string _locid="11286">Return to Media to defeat Makru, the Mad Median once and for all. Do not allow Retired General Zu&apos;s Town Center to be destroyed. </string>
		<string _locid="11291">My apologies for earlier. General Zu always makes me bare my claws. He&apos;s an old ox!\n \nNow, let me tell you this most brilliant idea I have for dealing with the Median Raiders.</string>
		<string _locid="11293">Quickly setup your own base, then destroy the enemy Town Center to cut off Makru&apos;s supply lines.</string>
		<string _locid="11298">Maybe meditation would help me handle this headache. I could get Retired General Zu to show me... Oh, that&apos;s right: he&apos;s out fighting the Mad Median.</string>
		<string _locid="11328">General Zu&apos;s Loyalists</string>
		<string _locid="11332">Return to the Diyala Valley in Media and destroy the Mad Median&apos;s Siege Workshops and Town Center.</string>
		<string _locid="11334">This is bad. Retired General Zu has rushed ahead to fight alone against Makru, the Mad Median. While truly bold, he is outmatched and his senility has gotten the best of him. He refuses help from my scouts and is attacking them on sight.\n \nNot only must you return to Media to defeat Makru, you also need to protect Retired General Zu&apos;s forces as best you can. They will attack you, but you must avoid attacking back. General Zu is too important to the stability of Babylon.</string>
		<string _locid="11375">Excellent work! General Zu is safe and with any luck, Media will remain stable from now on.\n \nWhich is good, because already new troubles have begun.</string>
		<string _locid="11379">Despite your earlier rescue, Retired General Zu is at it again.\n \nHe learned of a new Median warlord and immediately rushed off. Just like before, he refuses help from my scouts and is attacking them on sight.\n \nNot only must you return to Media to defeat this new warlord, you need to protect Retired General Zu&apos;s forces as best you can. They will attack you, but you must avoid attacking back.</string>
		<string _locid="11380">Return to Media to defeat the new Median warlord. Do not allow Retired General Zu&apos;s Town Center to be destroyed.</string>
		<string _locid="11382">And again, Babylon is in your debt! I&apos;ll try and keep a better watch on General Zu from now on.</string>
		<string _locid="11384">I am fairly certain General Zu is aware that he is actually retired, but good luck getting him to admit it.</string>
		<string _locid="11385">Makru, the Mad Median</string>
		<string _locid="11397">Babylon used to be a great city, ruled by Nebuchadnezzar.\n \nLife as part of the Persian Empire? Meh.</string>

		<string _locid="11490">The Babylonian merchant city of Eridu is under attack by the bandit commander Nikanuur. The city is home to our most prized Gardens, all of which have been captured by the cowardly marauder.\n \nTravel to Eridu to save the city and Gardens from Nikanuur!</string>
		<string _locid="11494">The people of Eridu celebrate in the streets. Men want to serve in your army, and women wish their sons and daughters to grow strong like you.</string>
		<string _locid="11504">I don&apos;t care for Persian music. I&apos;ll take that Oud time music any day!</string>
		<string _locid="11505">The Wonder stands. Well done recruit.</string>
		<string _locid="11507">The Wonder we built in Susa is under attack, again!\n \nThe Susa locals just don&apos;t appreciate the majesty of Babylon. You&apos;ll just have to convince them the hard way. Hold off the Susa attacks for as long as it takes. The Wonder must not fall.</string>
		<string _locid="11509">And again, the Wonder stands! Excellent work.</string>
		<string _locid="11514">I met Darius once, during the Egyptian campaign, when he was only a spearman. I didn&apos;t like him then either.</string>
		<string _locid="11516">Return to Susa</string>
		<string _locid="11527">Do you like Catapults?\n \nThey really are the perfect weapon. Thanks to Engineer Farzana, I have several modified versions of these fine machines ready to be tested. Just don&apos;t let her know I borrowed them!\n \nYou can test them out in Susa. There is a valley filled with Old Temples that should be fun to destroy. You can even try to wreck the locals&apos; houses, if you feel like being mean. Ha! Just be careful not to upset too many of them at once, they can get pretty angry.</string>
		<string _locid="11529">Use the modified Catapults provided by Retired General Zu to destroy the Old Temples. If you are feeling mean, destroy Houses as well. Be careful not to anger too many of the locals.</string>
		<string _locid="11530">Was I right? Fine Catapults indeed!</string>
		<string _locid="11531">I&apos;ve seen a lot of buildings made out of mud bricks in my time, but some of these Old Temples are the worst.</string>

		<string _locid="11539">The plan is to provide the Medians with a way to solve the raider problem themselves.\n \nI have already contacted an eager Median leader who will help us build this alliance. I just need you to safely escort the new Siege Towers from my workshops to his outpost in the Diyala Valley. Keep your eyes out for General Zu, he might try and stop us.

Unfortunately, they refuse to get along with each other, and are likely to die unless you help them with resources. Aid them with resources, and administer a crushing blow to these Raiders!</string>

		<string _locid="11785">I am hearing rumors of a plan to bring order to the neighboring territory of Susa by none other than Retired General Zu.\n \nUnfortunately, he is refusing to speak to me, and actually tried to throw a helmet at me when I approached him. Speak to him, learn his plan, and see what you can do to help. </string>
		<string _locid="11786">Alright recruit, the plan is simple, we are going to bring discipline and a sense of purpose to the people of Susa, we are going to build a monument to the majesty of Babylon, a Wonder. Phase one of this operation is to clear the way.\n \nTravel to Susa with the small compliment of troops I will provide you, build Fortresses at the marked locations, and do not let any of the local rabble-rousers get in your way. Move out!</string>
		<string _locid="11787">It&apos;s time to build the monument, a Babylonian Wonder, right where we know the people of Susa will be in awe. And it looks to be a race!\n \nAfter you returned from phase one, I had our people enlist the locals to dig canals at the build site. This did not sit well with some of the people of Susa. You will need to defend from their attacks as you complete construction of the Wonder. Use your priests to convert as many of the locals as you need. They might not like it now, but when this thing is finished they will be happy!</string>
		<string _locid="11788">Complete construction of the Babylonian Wonder, the Hanging Gardens. Use your priests to convert local villagers to assist you. Prepare for attacks.</string>
		<string _locid="11789">Word from Susa is not what we expected. A rebellion is brewing, and attacks are imminent.\n \nReturn to Susa and lead the defense. Use your Priests and any other forces you can muster to repel the attacking forces. We must defend our Wonder, now and for always! Failure is not an option!</string>

		<string _locid="11817">Use your Villagers and the Babylonian Ox Cart to accumulate Gold. Destroy Caravans controlled by the Disgruntled Gold Speculators for additional Gold.</string>
		<string _locid="11818">Wow, I&apos;m tired after all of the traveling that I&apos;ve been doing! It&apos;s time to take some scrolls outside and curl up.</string>
		<string _locid="11819">I&apos;ve actually lost count of how much Gold is still needed for the project, but you seem to be having so much fun, I figured you would want to keep at it.</string>
		<string _locid="11824">By using simple piece of wood and fabric, I believe I can construct a portable boat that also doubles as a sun hat. I&apos;ll be sure to offer you the first one!</string>
		<string _locid="11825">This should be enough Gold to make significant progress in the project.</string>
		<string _locid="11826">Oh, I can definitely see uses for all of this Gold along with funding my big project! I&apos;m going to have to make a list, or two...</string>
		<string _locid="11829">An impressive accomplishment! So much Gold, and all for Science! Well mostly.</string>
		<string _locid="11830">Ok, that&apos;s probably enough Gold for now.</string>
		<string _locid="11832">Thanks again for your help in Media, but now I need Gold for another project.\n \nThe rainy season is over, and Gold is plentiful along the banks of the rivers. There&apos;s a place along the Tigris that&apos;s teeming with Gold. Lead a Babylonian Ox Cart around and use your Villagers to gather Gold into it. Get lots!</string>
		<string _locid="11835">Ok we need more Gold. Thankfully, there&apos;s still plenty along the Tigris. Unfortunately, others are moving in.\n \nGold Speculators have been spotted and would love to find your Ox Cart laden with Gold. Get the Gold while you can, but don&apos;t stay at one deposit too long!</string>
		<string _locid="11836">My projections estimate, more Gold will be needed. But the Disgruntled Gold Speculators are getting tough!\n \nWe&apos;ve seen them patrolling deposits while waiting for their gatherers. But their Caravans keep getting stuck in the mud! As a way to speed up the Gold collecting, go for their Caravans, I bet each will give you a nice boost of Gold.</string>
		<string _locid="11838">At this point, let&apos;s just get more of the Gold while the Gold getting is still so good!\n \nBut beware, Disgruntled Gold Speculators are everywhere! Collect what Gold you can and look for more opportunities to take it from them.</string>
		<string _locid="11840">The Parthian Alliance</string>
		<string _locid="11842">Time heals all wounds, and it will take time with the landholders. The good news is that you saved the Northern Trade Depot, and our ally is pleased!\n \nRegretfully, there are still troublemakers to deal with.</string>
		<string _locid="11847">Well, that had to hurt! We won&apos;t be hearing from those landholders anytime soon!\n \nTime will tell if this squelches the rebellions.</string>
		<string _locid="11849">We certainly kicked the hornets&apos; nest in Parthia!\n \nInsulted that you&apos;ve beaten them, landholders are marching on the Parthian capital. Many of the empire&apos;s Siege Workshops are there, and we need them to crush the enemy. Thus it is imperative that we free the city and use the siege weapons to destroy the Rebellious Landholders.</string>
		<string _locid="11851">With so much turmoil in Parthia, I shall not be able to visit anytime soon. I hear their archery competitions are quite exciting.</string>
		<string _locid="11852">Give me your honest opinion. Does this tunic look &quot;stately&quot; enough? I want people to recognize me as their governor, not a fish merchant.</string>
		<string _locid="11853">It is a pity that my job requires so much of my attention. I wonder if my children even remember my name?</string>
		<string _locid="11854">This job adds another worry-wrinkle to my brow every year. My wife says it makes me look distinguished. I think it makes me look old.</string>
		<string _locid="11856">Parthian Rebels</string>
		<string _locid="11859">Free the Parthian capital and defend it. Defeat the Rebellious Landholders.</string>
		<string _locid="11860">With Makru defeated, we must now turn our attention to Parthia.\n \nA group of wealthy landholders have taken up arms and a loyal Parthian Ally requests assistance in quelling this rebellion. The landholders are operating out of a base that threatens our ally&apos;s Northern Trade Depot. The villages surrounding this base will aid us once they have been freed of landholder forces. Crush this rebellion before the Depot is lost.</string>
		<string _locid="11863">Even after your pounding, Rebellious Landholders are threatening the Parthian capital again!\n \nPerhaps you went too easy on them last time? Free and protect the Parthian Capital! Make the Rebellious Landholders regret this!</string>
		<string _locid="11864">Excellent! You have once again pulverized the Rebellious Landholders and saved me from another headache!</string>
		<string _locid="11867">Canyon Clearing</string>

		<string _locid="11872">Here we go again! A group of particularly stubborn landholders is causing trouble for our Parthian Ally.\n \nAssist our ally by clearing the Rebellious Landholders from the small town near their base. Then, with the assistance of our ally, crush the attacker where it hurts the most: their hometown!</string>
		<string _locid="11873">Parthian Rebels occasionally blockade the canyon near our ally&apos;s Trading Post.\n \nThis is to convince us to leave Parthia. With the canyon blocked, trade caravans halt. Trounce those Parthian Rebels! The ally&apos;s Town Center must not fall!</string>

It serves as a gateway to much of our commerce in the Tigris-Euphrates delta. The Marauders are threatening to destroy it.\n \nI need you to protect the Market in the River Merchants&apos; village! Marauders are tough too, so you had better get a friend!</string>
		<string _locid="11882">Marauders, Marauders, Marauders! That&apos;s all I hear about all day! Why don&apos;t they plunder elsewhere? I mean, the pickings here are easy enough, but where&apos;s the challenge?</string>
		<string _locid="11883">Protect the River Merchants&apos; Market from Marauders.</string>
		<string _locid="11891">The Marauders are pushing inland! We have to take the fight to them. Under the cover of night, assault their base, then find and kill the Marauder Captains. &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,&quot; said Hammurabi.\n \nOh, and don&apos;t forget a friend.</string>
		<string _locid="11900">The Marauders are truly relentless! They&apos;re on the move again.\n \nTheir target this time will likely be the White Temple of Uruk. The temple is essential to Uruk&apos;s political power, and if it falls, chaos will ensue. Protect the White Temple of Uruk to retain the city&apos;s hold on the Delta!\n \nYou&apos;ll need help yet again.</string>
		<string _locid="11901">People of Uruk</string>
		<string _locid="11902">I bet those Marauders did not enjoy wading through your defenses like they had enjoyed wading ashore!</string>
		<string _locid="11903">Protect the White Temple of Uruk against the Marauders.</string>
		<string _locid="11905">Got any clams? I don&apos;t. Probably because you haven&apos;t been helping the people of Uruk where all the clams come from. Perhaps you should go there now!</string>
		<string _locid="11910">Bringing down the law! The Hammurabi&apos;s law!</string>
		<string _locid="11911">We live in a land of plenty, but sometimes that comes with a steep cost. If we pay it with Marauder lives, we&apos;ll hopefully break even if we lose less of our own in the process. We must adhere to Hammurabi&apos;s budget!</string>
		<string _locid="11916">Not only did the Marauders feel Hammurabi&apos;s fist, but I think that you gave them a taste of his boot as well!</string>
		<string _locid="11917">When I&apos;m feeling down, reading Hammurabi&apos;s code puts me back on my feet again! I should write a sequel.</string>
		<string _locid="11918">Marauders are attacking the River Merchants... again!\n \nYou must show the Marauders that, no matter how many times they try, we&apos;re always going to defeat them. Always.\n \nAnd be sure to bring a friend, they might be better prepared this time.</string>
		<string _locid="11919">The Marauders are seemingly not afraid of us still.\n \nRaid their base once more, but this time at daybreak. Kill the Marauder Captains. Make them rue coming to our waters. And in case you forget, you will really want to consider bringing a friend along.</string>
		<string _locid="11920">Persian Marauders are back and looking to destroy the White Temple of Uruk.\n \nYou know what Hammurabi would do here, right? It&apos;s time for you and a friend to show them his fist to go along with his code!\n \nProtect the White Temple of Uruk from the Marauders.</string>
		<string _locid="11921">My colleagues and I have begun work on a secret project, a legendary Elixir with staggering potential. We have discovered the ingredients for it are scattered across distant lands.\n \nWe need you to travel to these places and gather up these ingredients for us. Hey! It sounds kind of like a scavenger hunt, doesn&apos;t it!</string>
		<string _locid="11923">I think I have developed a more efficient way to watch paint dry. Would you like to be my first test volunteer?</string>
		<string _locid="11925">You found the island? The people there worshipped a giant boar who was guarding the Fungal Growth? Sounds like a book I read the other day.\n \n Anyways, this Fungal Growth has some amazing properties. I bet the boar got so big because he was eating this stuff!</string>
		<string _locid="11926">I do believe that Fungal Growth has some fantastic research potential. If you can&apos;t find any, may I suggest looking between Zu&apos;s toes?</string>
		<string _locid="11927">Seventeen slippery scoundrels situated somewhere south stole some Sesame Seeds at sunset.\n \nWhew! Try and say that fast five times! One of our merchants had some Sesame Seeds that we need for the Elixir taken from him by a group of thieves. He tracked the thieves to their canyon hideout, which is blocked by stones. Tunnel your way in and get those Sesame Seeds back!</string>
		<string _locid="11928">Once I add these Sesame Seeds to the Elixir, the entire universe shall be revealed to me! But first, let me heat them up a bit. The taste will be divine!</string>
		<string _locid="11929">Once I have the Sesame Seeds, I have an experiment planned to combine them with a loaf of the baker&apos;s bread. I shall call it Farzana&apos;s Sesame Seed Bun of Wondrous Dimensions.</string>
		<string _locid="11930">People of the Loom</string>
		<string _locid="11933">I have a theory that Tiny Umbrellas could be used to protect you from getting soaked in the rain. Well, they would have to be a bit bigger I suppose...</string>
		<string _locid="11934">Far across the ocean live the People of the Loom, master weavers who specialize in making Tiny Umbrellas with their diminutive hands. These umbrellas would be a nice finishing touch for the Elixir.\n \nCollect the Tiny Umbrellas from the temples. Be wary of their defenders, the Priests of the Loom. I can&apos;t believe I just said that out loud.</string>
		<string _locid="11935">What? You think all the danger you faced just to get these Tiny Umbrellas was an unnecessary risk? I assure you, it may be the most important ingredient for the Elixir. You may have just guaranteed this drink will be supernaturally delicious!</string>

		<string _locid="11941">Far to the North, near the edge of the world, barbarian tribes keep bees that make the best Honey, a vital ingredient for the Elixir.\n \nWaterfalls dot the river you will be traveling on, so you will have to trek inland at times to gather up the Queen Bee&apos;s Honey. Avoid the Barbarian Bee Keepers if you can!</string>
		<string _locid="11942">This is honey fit for the gods themselves. One drop is as filling as a king&apos;s banquet. It may help if you ate a bit yourself to put some meat back on those bones! You nearly starved on the trip!</string>
		<string _locid="11944">Queen Bee&apos;s Honey would make a fantastic adhesive agent. I think I will test my theory using it between two pieces of bread?</string>
		<string _locid="11945">Barbarian Bee Keepers</string>
		<string _locid="11947">I have to admit, I got a little misty-eyed when I heard you had returned with the Tears of Isis. Unbelievable that they actually do exist! With these, we are now one step closer to finishing the elixir. I wonder what could make a god cry?</string>
		<string _locid="11948">I would hate to have been the one to ask Isis for her tears. Of course, if they had a practical scientific use, I might have been persuaded to tell her a sad story or two.</string>

		<string _locid="11951">Don&apos;t Cry for me Farzana</string>
		<string _locid="11952">The reaction to the Ambrosia has been so positive that my colleagues and I have decided to mass produce it and sell it to the public!\n \nWhat this means is that we would like you to get out there and collect all the ingredients for us again! Hey, why are you looking at me like that?</string>
		<string _locid="11953">Once again, you don&apos;t disappoint! With all these ingredients you have gathered, we have enough to begin production on Ambrosia right away. I had an idea of opening my very own stall in the marketplace to sell it to the public. I was thinking of calling it &quot;FarzanaMart.&quot; What do you think?</string>
		<string _locid="11954">You sure do look tired! I could give you some Ambrosia to perk you right up, but I seem to be all out. That&apos;s why we need you to gather the ingredients! </string>
		<string _locid="11955">One of the ingredients we need for the Elixir is Fungal Growth. Eww, that sounds gross!\n \nDespite the fact that I don&apos;t relish the thought of drinking something containing Fungal Growth, we still need it. I did some digging in some ancient texts and found mention of a far-off island where it is said to grow. It&apos;s not much to go on, but we need you to find the island and do what you must to obtain the Fungal Growth.</string>
		<string _locid="11956">Legend has it that there is a hidden Temple of Isis near the ancient city of Sebennytos. In this temple is supposedly a vial of her tears, which we happen to need for the Elixir.\n \nThe temple is likely to be heavily guarded, if it exists at all. If you find it, defeat these guardians and bring me the Tears of Isis.</string>

		<string _locid="12800">Once again, Vemundr and his whelps do too little, too late. When will he learn to quit bringing a dagger to a catapult fight? </string>
		<string _locid="12801">Press the attack until the city is taken. </string>
		<string _locid="12807">Keep the pressure on! Drive the enemy out of the city.</string>
		<string _locid="12809">I love the smell of burning Lackey fortresses in the morning. Smells like...  victory.</string>
		<string _locid="12812">Protect the Town Center at all costs. It must not fall!</string>
		<string _locid="12813">It was only a matter of time. \n \nLackeys of Beorix have landed close to the Greek mainland and are threatening the Argos Colonists. I need you to land your forces there and take control of the situation. I hear the Colonists like to do something they call &quot;surfing&quot;. You have two choices: you can fight or you can surf. I prefer you fight. Make them rue the day that they set their sights on Greece!</string>
		<string _locid="12816">The war has come to Greece. \n \nBeorix has launched an assault on the city of Argos. This cannot be allowed to stand. I want you to lead the forces into the city and liberate it. Fight for every street, fight house to house. Do what you have to do to kick that rabid dog out of Argos!</string>
		<string _locid="12817">It was a hard-won victory. Argos stands free again thanks to you. Fine work, my friend, fine work.</string>
		<string _locid="12818">Don&apos;t give an inch of ground. Take the city back at all costs.</string>
		<string _locid="12821">No mercy. Make Vemundr pay. Drive him from the city!</string>
		<string _locid="12825">Another day, another cowardly brother flees. I and the people of Argos salute you.</string>
		<string _locid="12826">Show the people of Argos we won&apos;t let them down. Push the Lackeys back and free the city.</string>
		<string _locid="12829">Go tell the Spartans. Go tell them that their home is safe. Their proud city still stands thanks to you. Tales of your valor will still be sung hundreds of years from now.</string>
		<string _locid="12830">Take and hold key positions throughout the city while pushing Beorix out.</string>
		<string _locid="12834">Sparta is now ours and Vemundr flees in terror. No one can stand in our way! Muhahaha!</string>
		<string _locid="12835">Push forward with all forces. Do not stop until the city is taken and Vemundr is defeated.</string>
		<string _locid="12837">As always, you have done well. The warriors of Sparta now look at you with true respect. </string>
		<string _locid="12839">So here at last, on the shores of the great sea, comes the end of our fellowship... err I mean the end of our long campaign. \n \nWe have Beorix and his Lackeys trapped on the coast. He has nowhere left to run now. I want you to lead the men in and take him out once and for all. His rampage of destruction and terror ends today!</string>
		<string _locid="12840">Wodan be praised! Beorix is no more! News of this great victory already spreads to all corners of the world. The people rejoice at the mention of your name. It has been an honor to serve with you. I am proud to call you friend!</string>
		<string _locid="12841">Total victory is now within our grasp. Press forward and eliminate Beorix and all of his forces.</string>
		<string _locid="12843">Can you hear it? Nothing. The cries of the seagulls have been silenced, the dead are avenged. \n \nYou have done all I have asked and more, my friend. Hope would have been lost without you. The people owe you a debt that can never be repaid. Rest now--you have earned it.</string>
		<string _locid="12854">Vemundr is here in Argos you say? \n \nHe tasks me. He tasks me and I shall have him! I&apos;ll chase him &apos;round Mount Olympus and &apos;round the Aegean Sea and &apos;round the forests of Dacia before I give him up! March on the city and take it! Don&apos;t let anything stand in your way, especially Vemundr!</string>
		<string _locid="12855">Our forces are stretched thin thanks to Beorix. \n \nOne of his brothers, of which there seems to be an endless supply, has circled back on us and attacked Argos again. I am calling upon you one more time to get in there and teach him a lesson he won&apos;t soon forget. Sad thing is, he does seem to forget because this keeps on happening!</string>
		<string _locid="12856">No one ever said that Beorix was smart. \n \nHe attacks Sparta, home to some of the finest warriors in the world. Brilliant. Trouble is, most of them are off fighting elsewhere. I need you to lead our forces into the city and make sure Beorix is unable to take it. Show the Spartans how great of a warrior you happen to be... by defending their home!</string>
		<string _locid="12857">Sparta. I laugh at Sparta. \n \n&quot;Home of the greatest warriors in the world?&quot; Time to show them what true warriors are like. Better yet, that bug Vemundr is here as well. Kill two birds with one stone, I say. Capture the city and defeat Vemundr while you&apos;re at it. Time to put him in his place.</string>
		<string _locid="12858">Greece is in chaos. There is now fighting on several fronts. \n \nWord has just arrived that another brother of Beorix has decided to make an appearance and is attempting to take Sparta again. Yes, yes, I know-as often as we&apos;ve had to fight them, there must be 300 brothers. Regardless, take your forces and secure the city. Drive his brother out of it!</string>
		<string _locid="12864">Capture and hold the Victory Towers and Treasuries throughout the city. Chief Vemundr must be near these buildings to capture them.</string>

		<string _locid="13003">While we have been busy elsewhere, Beorix&apos;s Brother has decided to slip behind us and attempt to recapture the Village of Sens. \n \nIt could be Beorix&apos;s 12th cousin once removed, for all I care--you need to get in there and show the people of Sens that they can always count on us to aid them. </string>
		<string _locid="13005">A new power is rising. Its road to victory is at hand!\n \nToday, the ground will be stained with the blood of Beorix and his Lackeys. March to the Village of Sens and confront them there. Leave none alive! To war!</string>
		<string _locid="13006">The Village of Sens is free! Never will it fall to the tyranny of Beorix!</string>
		<string _locid="13008">Do you hear that buzzing? It&apos;s that annoying little fly Vemundr again. Time to put him in his place. \n \nThe Village of Sens looks ripe for the picking. Lead my Lackeys into the place and plant a hammer square in Vemundr&apos;s skull. These people need to know when they&apos;re conquered.</string>
		<string _locid="13009">Will these people never learn? Now that their precious &quot;leader&quot; has been sent packing maybe they will wake up. The Village of Sens is ours.</string>
		<string _locid="13010">It seems that Beorix&apos;s whole family is a bunch of smelly loudmouths. Good to see the Village of Sens is free once again of their stench.</string>
		<string _locid="13011">How many brothers does Beorix have? No matter, we&apos;ll defeat them all.</string>
		<string _locid="13012">You must keep up the pressure and drive Beorix from the Village of Sens!</string>
		<string _locid="13013">Vemundr needs to be put in his place.</string>
		<string _locid="13014">Capture and hold the Victory Towers and Treasuries throughout the city. War Leader Beorix must be near these buildings to capture them.\n \nThis quest is very challenging for solo play. Co-op is recommended.</string>
		<string _locid="13017">This seems to be a recurring theme.\n \nBeorix&apos;s Brother has decided to slip behind us and attempt to recapture Crete. Which brother it is this time, I have no clue, but you need to get in there and show the people of Crete that they can always count on us to aid them. </string>
		<string _locid="13018">What a great sight it is to see Beorix&apos;s Brother running to the sea and trying to swim in all of that armor! At least the fish will get a meal. Once again, fine work. All of Crete thanks you.</string>
		<string _locid="13019">Boot Beorix&apos;s Brother out of Sparta. Take and hold key points throughout the city.</string>
		<string _locid="13021">Confront the Lackeys of Beorix along the Greek coast and defeat his forces once and for all.</string>
		<string _locid="13022">War Leader Beorix Must Survive</string>
		<string _locid="13052">You did well to get you and your men through enemy held territory to save the outpost. No one ever said war was fair.</string>
		<string _locid="13053">The area is thick with the enemy. It will be a tough fight to reach the Dacian Outpost.</string>
		<string _locid="13054">The Lackeys of Beorix have made another mistake. \n \nThey have allowed their army to be trapped along the coast. Lead our forces into battle and destroy this Lackey army. Wodan go with you.</string>
		<string _locid="13055">The Lackey army has been destroyed. Let us celebrate this great victory! Well done, my friend, well done.</string>
		<string _locid="13056">Press the attack and don&apos;t let up until all Lackey forces have been destroyed.</string>
		<string _locid="13057">Vemundr now flees from the flames of his defeat. I especially relish the fact you have done worse than kill him, you have hurt him. I wish you to go on hurting him. He will not soon recover from the loss of Argos.</string>
		<string _locid="13058">Allied Assault</string>
		<string _locid="13059">Throughout the ages, many of the finest warriors often worked together to overcome an enemy. \n \nThis still holds true on the battlefields of today. Only by gaining an ally to aid you can total victory be achieved.</string>
		<string _locid="13060">Excellent work! I shall compose a ballad to celebrate your victory!</string>
		<string _locid="13068">Ha ha! I knew it was you! Let this not be the last great deed you accomplish! </string>
		<string _locid="13069">Show no mercy! Scatter your enemy to the four winds!</string>
		<string _locid="13076">My eyes have seen no sight more beautiful than your taking that city the way you did. You are truly a god among men.</string>
		<string _locid="13077">You and your men will need to fight well to capture the city.</string>
		<string _locid="13080">The song that I heard must have been about you! You continue to personify the legends of old. Well done!</string>
		<string _locid="13083">Honor is the mark of a great warrior, and you are one of the greats. You have resisted the call of gold when so many others could not. Bravo!</string>
		<string _locid="13084">Gold holds a strange power over men. Do not fall into its deadly trap.</string>
		<string _locid="13086">My epic is nearly complete. \n \nIt tells the story of a man that represented the gods themselves, traveling the lands and achieving victory after victory on the field of battle. I have decided to base this epic on you, my friend. I believe that when history is done with you it will show you were unmatched in combat. May you never face defeat!</string>
		<string _locid="13088">Only those blessed by the gods themselves can achieve victory after victory.</string>
		<string _locid="13089">Alas, there will be time to rest later. \n \nScouts have reported that Beorix&apos;s forces are on the move once again, this time they actually mean to attack the city of Sparta! We must cross the mountains to beat him there. The pass we will use is most certainly guarded. The pass must be cleared of all enemy forces before we move on to Sparta!</string>
		<string _locid="13090">With the pass cleared, we have an unopposed road to Sparta. Beorix is in for a huge surprise when he sees us there waiting for him. Well done!</string>
		<string _locid="13091">The mountains conceal many enemies. It will be quite the undertaking to find and destroy them all.</string>
		<string _locid="13096">Beorix continues his march to the south. \n \nHis Lackeys have captured docks along the coast and are using them to ferry soldiers to Greece. Lead our forces into battle and make sure each of those docks is destroyed. We must prevent this war from spreading even further.</string>
		<string _locid="13097">With the docks out of commission, we have deprived Beorix of the ships he needed to carry his war further south. Well done.</string>
		<string _locid="13099">Bah! Are the very gods themselves against us? \n \nWord has just reached me that Beorix and much of his Lackey force managed to find other ships and sail south! His target appears to be Crete. I will need you to lead a force there to ensure Beorix fails in his plan to conquer the city. Wodan speed your journey!</string>
		<string _locid="13100">Only time will tell if we have stopped Beorix and his war of conquest. Failing to gain Crete has certainly dealt him a blow from which it will take him time to recover, at the very least. Excellent work my friend.</string>
		<string _locid="13102">The Cauldron of War</string>
		<string _locid="13104">Don&apos;t Reach Age III</string>
		<string _locid="13105">Don&apos;t Reach Age IV</string>
		<string _locid="13107">I did not think it possible! You are truly a master tactician. Well done! Now could you hand me my lute over there? I need to write a song commemorating this event. </string>
		<string _locid="13108">I think it&apos;s high time to flex our Norse muscle! \n \nI want you to build me a big boat, but not on the water! Har har! The place I want it built is crawling with Celtic Wanderers. You will need to hold them off while the wonder is completed. Once it is, the Celts will flee in terror! </string>
		<string _locid="13109">Can you hear the cries of the seagulls? They weep for all of those lives lost in this war. Those lives will all be avenged today! \n \nBeorix has made a critical error and our time to attack has come. We have surrounded the last of his Lackeys on the coast. More importantly, we have learned Beorix yet lives and is commanding them. This war ends today!</string>

		<string _locid="13124">Are you eager for perfection?\n \nI know of a warrior off to the East who was blessed with foresight in battle. Throughout his career, once he claimed a territory in battle, it remained under his control without fail. His conquests were flawless. Dare you attempt to equal his accomplishments? There is surely a song in it for you.</string>
		<string _locid="13125">How are things coming along?</string>
		<string _locid="13127">There is a rumor going around among the local villagers.\n \nA warrior has a appeared who has the reputation of crushing all that oppose him, showing no mercy. You wouldn&apos;t know anything about that would you?</string>
		<string _locid="13129">A true warrior, indeed! I am honored to have witnessed such a stunning example. I am humbled by your presence.</string>
		<string _locid="13132">Always stay ahead of your enemy. To fall behind means certain defeat.</string>
		<string _locid="13134">Do you like gold?\n \nI know that it is always tempting to pillage a city of its gold, but the legends speak of one clan leader who never became too greedy as he sacked an enemy city. Can you bring this legend to life and do the same? Resist the temptation!</string>
		<string _locid="13136">Have you ever heard the tale of the Lone Warrior?\n \nHis prowess in battle was so great that he was able to capture an entire city with only the aid of a handful of men. Do you think you could follow in his footsteps and do the same? </string>
		<string _locid="13137">In my lifetime I have only seen a handful of true warriors.\n \nWhat made them true warriors? They went into battle with nothing but the clothes on their back and a weapon. Perhaps you will equal this feat? Use no upgrades to defeat the enemy and prove yourself a true warrior. </string>
		<string _locid="13139">In all of my days I have never had the privilege to meet victory personified until now. I bow to your magnificence. My epic will carry your name throughout history.</string>
		<string _locid="13140">The air is heavy with the scent of battle.</string>
		<string _locid="13141">I remember a song I once heard about a battle for a city.\n \nThe warrior who was defending the city was always three moves ahead of the enemy. He was never in any danger of losing. Do you think you would be able to do the same if it came to it?</string>

		<string _locid="13147">There is troubling news from the North. \n \nThe drums of war have begun to beat in the lands of the Norse, a hardy people on both the land and sea. A call has gone out for heroes and commanders such as yourself lend them aid.\n \nSpeak with the Port Master in the Northern Hold as soon as you arrive.</string>
		<string _locid="13148">Your journey was not too harsh I hope! No matter, it is good that you have arrived.\n \nCeltic Wanderers are streaming into our lands from the South. We need a strong commander like you to take control of the situation. </string>
		<string _locid="13151">Beorix has truly gone mad! \n \nHe now marches south as we speak, into the Celtic homelands, leaving behind a swath of destruction. We need the support of the Celts if we are to have a chance at stopping him. Defend the Sacred Grove. Use the Training Camp for units and upgrades. Luck be with you!</string>
		<string _locid="13152">Excellent! The Celts should now lend us their support in defeating War Leader Beorix and his Lackeys. Hopefully we can end this war soon. </string>
		<string _locid="13153">You must turn the tide in this war.</string>
		<string _locid="13154">Sneak, Sail, and Smash!</string>
		<string _locid="13155">Lackeys of Beorix are threatening a Dacian outpost to the east. This outpost must not fall!\n \nThis is a chance for you to show the rest of the world these Norse troublemakers won&apos;t be allowed to do as they please. Muster what forces you can and defend that outpost at all costs!</string>
		<string _locid="13156">War Leader Beorix Killed</string>
		<string _locid="13157">Beorix&apos;s Brother Killed</string>
		<string _locid="13158">The race is on!</string>
		<string _locid="13159">I though you said you were up for the race?</string>
		<string _locid="13160">Just in the nick of time! A fine race, indeed.</string>
		<string _locid="13167">Do you like races?\n \nI hope you do. One of the brothers of War Leader Beorix has challenged us to compete in a Norse traditional smash-and-crash race. The basic idea is to run as fast as you can at a series of walls. Break down the walls and then reach the end zone before your competitor.\n \nIt can be painful, but it&apos;s lots of fun to watch.</string>
		<string _locid="13168">So, it looks like another brother of War Leader Beorix thinks he has what it takes to beat you in a not-so-friendly game of smash-and-crash.
